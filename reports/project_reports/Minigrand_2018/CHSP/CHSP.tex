\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Honeycomb Sandwich Composite~(HSC) is a type of multi-layered structure, which 
is composed of the mid-core with the geometry of honeycomb sandwiched between 
thin skins.
They are widely used in the aerospace, marine and automotive industries due to 
the high strength-to-weight ratio, high energy absorption capability and 
effective acoustic insulation.
However, these complex structures are exposed to various types of damage that are not found in metal alloy materials, e.g. hidden disbonds between the skin and the core, delamination of the skin plates, or the core impact damage.
They can occur either during a manufacturing process, storage or in-service life.
Because of this, advanced methods are required for on-line damage detections.

The structural health monitoring (SHM) method with very high potential is the method based on the Guided Wave (GW) propagation \cite{mustapha2011assessment, sikdar2016guided, sikdar2016ultrasonic,radzienski2016assessment, yu2019core}.
GW are mechanical waves that propagate in a bounded, elastic medium, e.g. bars, 
beams, rods, plates and shells.
Excitation and sensing of the GW can be realised by the lightweight and inexpensive piezoelectric transducers (PZT) \cite{giurgiutiumicromechatronics}.
The compact PZT can be surface-bonded to the inspected structure or even embedded between the composite plies so that the measurements can be conducted in situ. Among numerous techniques developed for damage detection and localisation, the most popular are pitch{catch \cite{ihn2008pitch, sikdar2017structural}, pulse--echo \cite{guo1993interaction, kudela2008damage}, phase array \cite{lu2006crack, ostachowicz2008elastic}, and time-reversal mirror \cite{fink1992time, eremin2016analytically}.

The most common numerical modelling of the phenomenon of GW in HSC found in the literature is a calculation of the effective material properties of the 
honeycomb structure by the homogenisation process~\cite{shi1995derivation, qi2008ultrasonic, mustapha2014leaky, baid2015dispersion, sikdar2016guided}.
However, this method is not able to adequately present the phenomenon of 
propagation of elastic waves in such material.
A more accurate model will be achieved if the real geometry of the hexagonal 
cell is retained.

Ruzzenne et al. presented a parametric study to evaluate the dynamic behavior of the honeycomb and cellular structures through the finite element model 
and the application of the theory of periodic structures \cite{ruzzene2003wave}.
Recently, the simulations of the wave propagation in the HSC have been conducted 
with the commercially available finite element code~\cite{song2009guided, 
hosseini2013numerical, tian2015wavenumber, zhao2018wave}.
However, finite element simulations (FEM) of GW are inefficient as they require 
significant amounts of memory and are time-consuming.

The computational efficiency of the FEM in case of GW modelling in the HSC can be improved by using the time-domain spectral element method (SEM).
The SEM was originally used for the numerical solution of the fluid flow 
in a channel by Patera \cite{patera1984spectral} but has also been successfully developed for elastic wave propagation~\cite{ostachowicz2011guided}. 
Kudela proposed a model of the GW in HSC by the parallel implementation of the SEM \cite{kudela2016parallel}.
However, this model had a large number of degree-of-freedom (DOF), because cells of the core and skin plate were modelled by the three-dimensional (3D) spectral elements.
Therefore, the simulation was limited to only one skin plate and the small dimension of the HSC (\(179 \times 159 \) mm).

Above mentioned drawbacks were motivation to propose a new model of the HSC. 
In the present paper, the skin plates, adhesive layers and each wall of the hexagonal core were modelled by two-dimensional (2D) spectral elements.
The displacements of each cell are calculated in the local coordinate system, 
and then, through the transformation matrix, they are transformed into the 
global coordinate system.
Subsequently, the core is connected to the skin plates so that displacements of 
common geometrical points of both elements are the same in each direction of 
the main axes.
This type of connection is implemented by means of interface elements based on 
Lagrange multipliers, which are interpreted as forces responsible for 
determining the appropriate displacements of nodes.
By using the interface, it is possible to model skin plates with 2D elements.
This type of approach will reduce the number of degrees of freedom, which in 
turn will shorten the calculation time and reduce the need for operational 
memory.

Signal excitation and receiving were realised by the piezoelectric (PZT) transducers, which was modelled by a three-dimensional (3D) spectral element with the electromechanical coupling.
\section{The time-domain spectral element method formulation}
\label{sec:time_SEM}
\subsection{The spectral element method}
\label{sec:sem}
The general concept of the SEM is based on the idea of the FEM.
The similarity of both methods lies in the fact that the modelled domain is divided into non-overlapping finite elements, and external forces and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed in the particular nodes.
The main difference between those methods is a choice of the shape function \( N=N(\xi )\), which is interpolated by Lagrange polynomial that passes through the element nodes. The nodes are localized on the endpoint of an interval, \(\xi\in[-1,1]\) and the roots of the first derivative of Legendre polynomial of degree \(p-1\):

\begin{eqnarray}
(1-\xi^2)P'_{p-1}(\xi)=0
\label{eq:nodes}
\end{eqnarray}

The approximation of an integral over the elements is achieved according to Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) rule at points coinciding with the element nodes, 
and the weights \(w=w(\xi)\) calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
{w(\xi)} = \frac{2}{p(p-1)(P_{p-1}(\xi))^2}
\label{eq:weights}
\end{eqnarray}
This approach guarantees a diagonal mass matrix.
The shape functions and the weights for 2D or 3D elements are obtained by the Kronecker product of vectors of individual axes, denoted by \(\otimes\) as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
N(\xi,\eta) = N(\xi)\otimes N(\eta), & N(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = N(\xi)\otimes N(\eta)\otimes N(\zeta) \nonumber\\
w(\xi,\eta) = w(\xi)\otimes w(\eta), & w(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = w(\xi)\otimes w(\eta)\otimes w(\zeta) 
\label{eq:3Dshape_weights}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{2D spectral modelling}
\label{sec:2D_SEM}

According to the first-order shear deformation theory~\cite{reissner1945effect, mindlin1951influence} the vector of displacements is expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{v}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{w}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)
\end{array} \right\} = 
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}_0^e(\xi,\eta) + z\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e(\xi,\eta)\\
\textbf{v}_0^e(\xi,\eta) + z\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e(\xi,\eta)\\
\textbf{w}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\end{array} \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{u}_0^e\), \(\textbf{v}_0^e\) and \(\textbf{w}_0^e\) are nodal displacements, \(\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e\), \(\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e\) are the rotations of the normal to the mid-plane with respect to axes \textit{x} and \textit{y}, respectively.
\begin{eqnarray}
\left \{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\textbf{v}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\textbf{w}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e(\xi,\eta)
\end{array} \right\}
& = & \textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta)\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e\nonumber\\
& = & \sum_{n=1}^q\sum_{m=1}^p\textbf{N}_m^e(\xi)\textbf{N}_n^e(\eta)
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\widehat{\textbf{u}}_0^e \\
\widehat{\textbf{v}}_0^e \\
\widehat{\textbf{w}}_0^e \\
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}_x^e \\
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}_y^e
\end{array} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
The nodal bending strain-displacement relations are given in the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_b^e =
\textbf{B}_b^e\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e = 
\left [
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & -\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x}
\end{array} \right]
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}_0^e \\
\textbf{v}_0^e \\
\textbf{w}_0^e \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e
\end{array} \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
The nodal shear strain-displacement relations are given in the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_s^e =
\textbf{B}_s^e\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e = 
\left [
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & 0 & -1
\end{array} \right]
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}_0^e \\
\textbf{v}_0^e \\
\textbf{w}_0^e \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e
\end{array} \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{3D model of the PZT transducer}
\label{sec:3D_SEM}
The displacements vector of the PZT transducer is composed of three translational displacements, and it is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{v}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{w}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)
\end{array} \right\}
& = & \textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta, \zeta)\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e\nonumber\\
& = & \sum_{l=1}^r\sum_{n=1}^q\sum_{m=1}^p\textbf{N}_m^e(\xi)\textbf{N}_n^e(\eta)\textbf{N}_l^e(\zeta)
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\widehat{\textbf{u}}^e(\xi_m,\eta_n,\zeta_l) \\
\widehat{\textbf{v}}^e(\xi_m,\eta_n,\zeta_l) \\
\widehat{\textbf{w}}^e(\xi_m,\eta_n,\zeta_l)
\end{array} \right\}
\label{eq:3D_displ}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\widehat{\textbf{u}}^e\), \(\widehat{\textbf{v}}^e\) and 
\(\widehat{\textbf{w}}^e\) are displacements of the element nodes in \(\xi,\eta\) and \(\zeta\) direction.

The nodal strain-displacement relations are given as \cite{kudela20093d}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^e=\textbf{B}_{d}^e\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e=
\left [
\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x} & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & 0\\
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial z}\\
0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial z} & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y}\\
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial z} & 0 & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial N^e}{\partial x} & 0
\end{array} \right]
\left \{ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}^e \\
\textbf{v}^e \\
\textbf{w}^e
\end{array} \right\}
\end{eqnarray}

The electromechanical coupling is governed by the linear constitutive equation of piezoelectric material according to~\cite{giurgiutiumicromechatronics, rekatsinas2017cubic}, and it is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ 
\begin {array}{c}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}\\
\textbf{D}
\end{array}\right ]=
\left [ 
\begin{array}{cc}
\textbf{c}^E & -\textbf{e}^T \\
\textbf{e} & \epsilon^S 
\end{array} \right ]
\left[ 
\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{S}\\
\textbf{E} 
\end{array} \right ]
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{c}^E\) is the stiffness coefficients measured at zero electric field, \textbf{e} is the piezoelectric coupling tensor and \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^S\) electric permittivity, \textbf{E} and \textbf{D} are the electric field and electric displacement measured at zero strain.
The superscript T denotes transpose matrix.
The eElectric field is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{E}^e=-\textbf{B}_\phi^e \widehat{\phi}^e = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial \xi}\\
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial \eta}\\
\frac{\partial N^e}{\partial \zeta}
\end{array} \right] \widehat{\phi}^e
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Displacements coupling at the substructures interface}
\label{sec:interface}
The present model of the sandwich panel consists of 2D and 3D elements. 
Moreover, there are non-matching grids between two adjacent substructures. 
These involve connecting them by imposing the compatibility of the displacements at the interface, see Fig.~\ref{fig:interface}.
This type of connection is implemented through the interface elements based on Lagrange multipliers, which are interpreted as forces responsible for determining the appropriate displacements of nodes.
The coupling can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}\\
\textbf{v}\\
\textbf{w}
\end{array}\right\}_{s_{i1}}^{\Gamma^i}-
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}\\
\textbf{v}\\
\textbf{w}
\end{array}\right\}_{s_{i2}}^{\Gamma^i}=
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{0}\\
\textbf{0}\\
\textbf{0}
\end{array}\right\}
\label{eq:coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../../figures/eps/interface_2D3D.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Non-matching interface setup: a) interface coupling, b) degrees-of-freedom of the interface and the substructures, c) the nodes of the 3D substructure, d) interface nodes inherited from 3D substructure, e) interface nodes projection on the 2D substructure, f) the nodes of the 2D substructure}
	\label{fig:interface}
\end{figure}
where \(s_{i1}\) and \(s_{i2}\) are substructures connected by the interface \(\Gamma^i\). For the whole structure, the Eq.~\ref{eq:coupling} can be written in the matrix form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{G}\textbf{d}=\textbf{0}
\label{eq:cond_disp}
\end{eqnarray}
where \textbf{G} is the coupling matrix which contains the equations to interpolate the substructures displacements at the interfaces, and \(\textbf{d}\) is a global vector of displacements for \(nS\) number of substructures, composed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{d} = \left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
\textbf{d}_1, & \textbf{d}_2, &\ldots, & \textbf{d}_{nS}
\end{array}\right\}^T
\label{eq:displacements}
\end{eqnarray}

	\caption{Matrix G formulation}
	\label{alg:G_matrix}
\end{algorithm}
The general formulation of the matrix \textbf{G} is proposed in Algorithm \ref{alg:G_matrix}.
The main task of the algorithm is to calculate shape functions for each adjacent substructures at the points \(X_p=(x_p^k,y_p^k)\), which are projections of the interface nodes onto these substructures.
The shape function can be calculated after finding an owner element and local coordinates of the points.
Owner element is a spectral element in the domain of the substructure \(s_{ij}\) which contains interface node, for example, interface node \(k_\Gamma=36\) (see~Fig.~\ref{fig:interface}a)) is located in the element \(e^{I}_{3D}\) and \(e^{III}_{2D}\) for the substructures \(s_{11}\) and \(s_{12}\), respectively.
It can be found within two ways: using Matlab's built-in function \verb+inpolygon+ or more efficient procedure proposed by Silva et al. \cite{silva2009exact} which was used in the current implementation.
The transformation from global to local coordinates was realised by the iterative method presented in the work of Li et al.~\cite{li2014efficient}.

The computational effectiveness of Algorithm~\ref{alg:G_matrix} can be easily improved if certain precautions are taken.
Firstly, the mesh of the interface has to be based on the mesh from one of the substructures \(s_i1\), \(s_i2\), which may be referred to as a slave.
So, the shape function takes only the values of one and zeros.
Moreover, the code can be implemented in vectorized form rather than using a for-loops.

\subsection{Elementary governing equations of motion}
\label{sec:motion}
The classical equations of motion \(\textbf{M}\ddot{\textbf{d}} + \textbf{C}\dot{\textbf{d}} + \textbf{K}\textbf{d} = \textbf{F}\) known from FEM are complemented by piezoelectric and interface coupling. Thus, the governing equations are defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{M}_{dd} \widehat{\ddot{\textbf{d}}} + \textbf{C}_{dd} \widehat{\dot{\textbf{d}}} + \textbf{K}_{dd} \widehat{\textbf{d}} + \textbf{K}_{d\phi} \widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}} = \textbf{F} - \textbf{G}^T \boldsymbol{\lambda},
\label{eq:motion}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{K}_{\phi d}\widehat{\textbf{d}} + \textbf{K}_{\phi \phi} \widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}} = \textbf{Q}
\label{eq:piezocoupling}
\end{eqnarray} 

where \(\textbf{M}_{dd}\), \(\textbf{C}_{dd}\), \(\textbf{K}_{dd}\) are structural mass, damping and stiffness matrices, respectively; \(\textbf{K}_{\phi d}={\textbf{K}_{d\phi}}^T\) are piezoelectric coupling matrices; \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}\) is the dielectric permittivity matrix, \(\widehat{\textbf{d}}\) is the vector of unknown nodal displacements, and \(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\) is the electric potential vector; \(\textbf{F}\) the nodal external force vector, \(\textbf{Q}\) is the nodal charge vector, \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) is the Lagrange multipliers vector, and \(\textbf{G}\) is the interface coupling matrix; \((\dot{\ })=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\).
The formulae of the matrices are provided in App.~\ref{app:matrices}.
The coupling is realised by imposing the traction forces, represented by a vector of Lagrange multipliers. 

\subsection{Transformation of the core elements}
\label{sec:transformation}
All core elements are rotated relative to both skins, so it is necessary to transform degrees of freedom from the local core's coordinate system to the global system.
For this purpose, an additional sixth global dof has been incorporated, i.e. rotation with respect to the z-axis.
Firstly, a part of the mass matrix accounted for rotary inertia (see App. \ref{app:matrices}) is globalised as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{M}_R^g=\textbf{a}\,\textbf{M}_R^l\,\textbf{a}^{-1}
\label{eq:inertia}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{a}\) is general rotation matrix obtained from the multiplication of basic rotation matrices, and for the regular hexagonal core a is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{a}=\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
m & -n & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1\\
n & m & 0\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:rotation}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(m=\cos(\alpha),\:n=\sin(\alpha)\), for \(\alpha\in{[0^\circ,\,60^\circ,\,120^\circ,180^\circ,\,240^\circ,\,300^\circ]}\) depending on which wall of the cell it is applied to.

The stiffness--strain relationship in local and global coordinate systems is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^l_{11}\\
\sigma^l_{22}\\ 
\sigma^l_{33}\\ 
\sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{c}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^l_{11}\\
\epsilon^l_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^l_{33}\\
\gamma^l_{23}\\
\gamma^l_{13}\\
\gamma^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ], & and &
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\bar{\textbf{c}}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^g_{11}\\
\epsilon^g_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^g_{33}\\
\gamma^g_{23}\\
\gamma^g_{13}\\
\gamma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\end{array}
\label{eq:stress_global}
\end{eqnarray}
The global form of the stiffness matrix \(K\), involves the determination of stiffness tensor \(\bar{c}\) from Eq.~\ref{eq:stress_global}.
The transformation of the stress tensor is expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^g_{11} & \sigma^g_{12} & \sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{21} & \sigma^g_{22} & \sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{31} & \sigma^g_{32} & \sigma^g_{33}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
=
\textbf{a}\,
\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^l_{11} & \sigma^l_{12} & \sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{21} & \sigma^l_{22} & \sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{31} & \sigma^l_{32} & \sigma^l_{33}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\,\textbf{a}^T
\label{eq:sigma_tensor}
\end{eqnarray}
After the multiplication of matrices and using the symmetry of the stress tensor Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tensor} can be rewritten in a simplified form:

\begin{eqnarray}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}

\label{eq:stress}
\end{eqnarray}

Analogously, a strain relationship also is given in the form:

\end{array}
\right ]
\end{array}
\label{eq:strain}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{R}\) is the Reuter's matrix, defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{R} = \left [
\begin{array}{cccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0\\

0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:reuters}
\end{eqnarray}
Using the Eqs.~\ref{eq:rotation} through \ref{eq:reuters}, the relationship of stress--strain in the global frame can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\

\right ]=
\textbf{T}\,\textbf{c}\,\textbf{R}\,\textbf{T}^{-1}\,\textbf{R}^{-1}\,
\left [

\gamma^g_{23}\\
\gamma^g_{13}\\
\gamma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:stress-strain}
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, transformed stiffness tensor for the core's elements is equal:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{\textbf{c}}=\textbf{T}\,\textbf{c}\,\textbf{R}\,\textbf{T}^{-1}\,\textbf{R}^{-1}
\label{eq:c_global}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{A solution of the equation of motion}
\label{sec:time_integration}
Assuming \(\textbf{b}\) and \(\textbf{f}\) represent order lists of the electrodes nodes and free nodes of the PZT, respectively, the electrical potential vector is rewritten:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}} = \left \{\begin{array}{cc}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\textbf{b}) &
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\textbf{f})
\end{array}\right \}^T
\label{eq:potential}
\end{eqnarray}
Then, Eq. \ref{eq:piezocoupling} is expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{K}_{\phi d}(\textbf{b},:) \\
\textbf{K}_{\phi d}(\textbf{f},:)
\end{array}\right]
\left \{\widehat{\textbf{d}}\right\} +
\left [\begin{array}{cc}
\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}(\textbf{b},\textbf{b}) & \textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}(\textbf{b},\textbf{f})\\
\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}(\textbf{f},\textbf{b}) & \textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}(\textbf{f},\textbf{f})
\end{array}\right]
\left \{\begin{array}{c}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\textbf{b}) \\
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\textbf{f})
\end{array}\right \} = 
\left \{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{Q} \\
\textbf{0}
\end{array}\right \}
\label{eq:piezoboundary}
\end{eqnarray} 
where the notation \(\textbf{K}(\textbf{row},\textbf{col})\) uses vectors \(\textbf{row}\) and \(\textbf{col}\) to extract rows and columns from the matrix \(\textbf{K}\), respectively, and \((:)\) means all rows or columns of \(\textbf{K}\).
The electrical potential of the free nodes can be extracted from Eq. \ref{eq:piezoboundary}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\textbf{f}) = -\textbf{K}_{\phi\phi}^{-1}(\textbf{f},\textbf{f})\left[\textbf{K}_{\phi d}(\textbf{f},:) \widehat{\textbf{d}} + \textbf{K}_{\phi\phi}(\textbf{f},\textbf{b})\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\textbf{b}) \right]
\label{eq:freePotetial}
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting Eq. \ref{eq:potential} and \ref{eq:freePotetial} into Eq. \ref{eq:motion}, the equation of motion can be rearranged into the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{M}_{dd} \widehat{\ddot{\textbf{d}}} + \textbf{C}_{dd} \widehat{\dot{\textbf{d}}} + (\textbf{K}_{dd}-\textbf{K}_{s}) \widehat{\textbf{d}}  = \textbf{F} + \textbf{K}_{a} \widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(b) - \textbf{G}^T \boldsymbol{\lambda},
\label{eq:motionD}
\end{eqnarray}
where  \(\textbf{K}_a=\textbf{K}_{d\phi}(:,f)\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{-1}(f,f)\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}(\textbf{f},\textbf{b})-\textbf{K}_{d\phi}(:,\textbf{b})\), \(\textbf{K}_s=\textbf{K}_{d \phi}(:,\textbf{f})\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{-1}(\textbf{f},\textbf{f})\textbf{K}_{\phi d}(\textbf{f},:)\).
The unknown vector of displacements \(\widehat{\textbf{d}}_t\) is found using a central difference algorithm \cite{kudela20093d}.
Thus, Eq.~(\ref{eq:motionD}) is rewritten as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left(\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}+\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd} \right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_{t+\Delta t}=
\textbf{F}_t+\textbf{K}_a\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}_t(b)-\left( \textbf{K}_{dd}-\textbf{K}_s\right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_t\nonumber\\
+\frac{2}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}\widehat{\textbf{d}}_t-\left(\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}-\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd}\right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_{t-\Delta t}-\textbf{G}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t
\label{eq:CDE}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\Delta t\) is the time increment.

Imposing the constrain Eq. \ref{eq:cond_disp}, the vector of Lagrange multipliers \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t\) can be extracted from Eq. \ref{eq:CDE}:\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t = {\left(\textbf{G}\textbf{L}_+^{-1}\textbf{G}^T \right)}^{-1}\textbf{G}\textbf{L}_+^{-1} \Bigg[ \textbf{F}_t+\textbf{K}_a\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}_t(b)+\left.\left(\frac{2}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}-\textbf{K}_{dd}+\textbf{K}_s\right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_t -\textbf{L}_-\widehat{\textbf{d}}_{t-\Delta t} \right]
\label{eq:lambda}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{L}_{\pm}=\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}\pm\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd}\).

\subsection{Simulation parameters}
\label{sec:simulation}
The inversion of the matrix \(\left [\textbf{GL}_+^{-1}\textbf{G}^T\right ]\) is necessary to calculate the vector of Lagrange multipliers in Eq. \ref{eq:lambda}).
While \(\textbf{L}_+\) is a diagonal matrix, the sparsity of the matrix \(\textbf{G}\) has a significant influence on the computation cost.
Therefore, during the generation of the mesh, the following steps were taken to reduce the number of non-zero matrix values in the matrix \(\textbf{G}\).

One spectral element was intended for each wall of the honeycomb core, while the meshes of the skin plates and the adhesive layers were divided by three rhombus elements per area under the core cell.
In this way, the interface nodes coincide with the nodes lying on the hexagon edges (thick line on Fig. \ref{fig:skin_mesh} b)).
In the case of PZT transducers, the mesh was generated by using external GMSH software \cite{geuzaine2009gmsh} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:skin_mesh} c)).
To achieve at least six nodes per wavelength within the assumed excitation range, 2D and 3D elements consist of \(4 \times 4\) and \(4 \times 4 \times 4\) nodes, respectively.

	\label{fig:signal}
\end{figure}

The analysis was conducted with a narrowband excitation signal in the form of five-cycles sine pulse in a Hanning window with the central frequency 20 kHz (Fig.~\ref{fig:signal}).

\subsection{Homogenised model}
\label{sec:homogenization}
In the paper, comparative studies were carried out between the current model and the homogenised one. 
In the homogenised model, the values of material constants of the panel core were calculated according to the method presented by Malek and Gibson \cite{malek2015effective}.
The orthotropic mechanical properties for aluminium core are gathered in Table \ref{tab:properties_eff}, while the properties for other structures, i.e. skins, adhesive layers and sensors remained unchanged.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Comparison of the models}
The advantage of the present model in comparison to the homogenised one can be immediately pointed out by analysis of the propagating wavefield (see Fig. \ref{fig:wavefield}).
The wavefield of the proposed model is much more realistic.
It reveals wave entrapment in the honeycomb cells.
Such an effect is not present in the homogenised model.
It also causes, that S0 to A0 mode conversion at sensor location is much more visible in the homogenised model (Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefield} left) than in the proposed model (Fig. \ref{fig:wavefield} right).

It can be noticed in Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefield}) that the wave propagates in a manner typical for orthotropic material in case of both models, i.e. the wave velocity depends on the angle of propagation.
In addition to the material properties of skins, velocity profiles highly depend on the core properties.
This behaviour can be observed for both models.
The highest velocities of A0 and S0 mode are observed in $0^{\circ}$ direction, while the minimum values are for $45^{\circ}$ (see. Fig.~\ref{fig:speed}).
The A0 mode velocities are significantly lower in the current model than in the homogenised one.
The differences are in a range from 12 to 29\%, and only up to 3\% for S0 mode.  

In Fig.~\ref{fig:velocity} d) one can also notice differences in the particles velocity amplitude after the pulse has passed.
For that period, the amplitude of particle velocity \(V_z\) is 2.8 times higher for the present model, due to reflections of the wave within the core walls.

\end{figure}

Therefore, differences in values recorded by the sensor are expected, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:voltage}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
In the paper, numerical model of sandwich panel has been implemented with the actual geometry of the honeycomb core.
In contrast to  full structure homogenisation, which is the most common HSC model found in the literature, the interaction of the propagating wave with core cell walls is visible in the current model.
Moreover, the model is computationally efficient due to the use of SEM and 2D elements.
The present model has 25 times less number of DOF than a full 3D model (according to \cite{kudela2016parallel}, estimated no of DOF is twelve million) and only 1.2 more than the homogenised model.

In the future works, the model will be adapted to parallel calculations using a multi-core graphics card, which will further reduce solution time. Experimental research will also be conducted to test the proposed method on physical samples.
