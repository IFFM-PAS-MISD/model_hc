Therefore, a numerical analysis will be carried out in order to gain knowledge about the influence of the damage size on the propagation of elastic waves in the honeycomb sandwich composite panel.
For this purpose, a panel has been modelled taking into account the real geometry of the honeycomb core using the time-domain specral element method and two-dimensional elements.
The damage under investigation was the disbond between the skin and the core of the panel.
The use of two-dimensional elements required connecting the nodes of adjacent elements, which was realized by means of an interface based on Lagrange multipliers.
The result of the parametric study is a function of damage influence on the amplitude of propagating waves.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Honeycomb Sandwich Composite~(HSC) is a type of multi-layered structure, which is composed of the mid-core with the geometry of honeycomb sandwiched between thin skins.
They are widely used in the aerospace, marine and automotive industries due to the high strength-to-weight ratio, high energy absorption capability and effective acoustic insulation.
However, these complex structures are exposed to various types of damage that are not found in metal alloy materials, e.g. hidden disbonds between the skin and the core, delamination of the skin plates, or the core impact damage.
They can occur either during a manufacturing process, storage or in-service life.
Because of this, advanced methods are required for on-line damage detections.

The structural health monitoring (SHM) method with very high potential is the method based on the Guided Wave (GW) propagation \cite{mustapha2011assessment, sikdar2016guided, sikdar2016ultrasonic,radzienski2016assessment, yu2019core}.
GW are mechanical waves that propagate in a bounded, elastic medium, e.g. bars, beams, rods, plates and shells.
The wavelength of GW is longer than the thickness of bounding elastic medium.
An excitation and sensing of the GW can be realised by the lightweight and inexpensive piezoelectric transducers (PZT) \cite{giurgiutiumicromechatronics}.
The compact PZT can be surface-bonded to the inspected structure or even embedded between the composite plies so that the measurements can be conducted in situ.
Among numerous techniques developed for damage detection and localisation, the most popular are pitch--catch \cite{ihn2008pitch, sikdar2017structural}, pulse--echo \cite{guo1993interaction, kudela2008damage}, phase array \cite{lu2006crack, ostachowicz2008elastic}, and time-reversal mirror \cite{fink1992time, eremin2016analytically}.
	
The most common numerical modelling of the phenomenon of GW in HSC found in the literature is a calculation of the effective material properties of the honeycomb structure by the homogenisation process~\cite{shi1995derivation, qi2008ultrasonic, mustapha2014leaky, baid2015dispersion, sikdar2016guided}.
However, this method is not able to adequately present the phenomenon of propagation of elastic waves in a such material.
A more accurate model will be achieved if the real geometry of the hexagonal cell is retained.
	
Ruzzenne et al. presented a parametric study to evaluate the dynamic behavior of the honeycomb and cellular structures through the finite element model and the application of the theory of periodic structures \cite{ruzzene2003wave}.
Recently, the simulations of the wave propagation in the HSC have been conducted with the commercially available finite element code~\cite{song2009guided, hosseini2013numerical, tian2015wavenumber, zhao2018wave}.
However, finite element simulations (FEM) of GW are inefficient as they require significant amount of memory and are time-consuming.

The computational efficiency of the FEM in case of GW modelling in the HSC can be improved by using the time-domain spectral element method (SEM).
The SEM was originally used for the numerical solution of the fluid--flow in a channel by Patera \cite{patera1984spectral} but has also been successfully developed for elastic wave propagation~\cite{ostachowicz2011guided}.
Kudela proposed a model of the GW in HSC by the parallel implementation of the SEM \cite{kudela2016parallel}.
However, this model had a large number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF), because cells of the core and skin plate were modelled by the three-dimensional (3D) spectral elements.
Therefore, the simulation was limited to only one skin plate and the small dimension of the HSC (\(179 \times 159 \) mm).

Above mentioned drawbacks were motivation to propose a new model of the HSC. In the present paper, the skin plates, adhesive layers and each wall of the hexagonal core were modelled by two-dimensional (2D) spectral elements.
However, 2D elements have nodes only in a mid-plane, therefore, there is no direct connection between the two adjacent structures.
This conection was implemented by interface elements based on Lagrange multipliers \cite{ashwin2014formulation, fiborek20192d}.
Additionally, the signal was generated and recorded with piezoelectric transducers (PZT), while Kudela excited the waves with an external force applied at the point of the panel \cite{kudela2016parallel}.
A non-matching interface between the transducers and the skin was used to avoid too complex mesh, likewise to the interfaces developed for the FEM \cite{flemisch2000elasto, flemisch2012non}. To the best of authors’
knowledge, it has not been implemented for the SEM.

The parametric study conducted in the paper leads to the determination of a model-assisted damage identification function (MADIF), which determines the influence of the size of the composite defect on wave propagation.
In this case, the defect is assumed to be a disbond between the skin and the core.

\section{The time-domain spectral element method formulation}
\label{sec:time_SEM}
\subsection{The spectral element method}
\label{sec:sem}
The general concept of the SEM is based on the idea of the FEM.
The similarity of both methods lies in the fact that the modelled domain is divided into non-overlapping finite elements, and external forces and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed in the particular nodes.
The main difference between those methods is a choice of the shape function \( N=N(\xi )\), which is interpolated by Lagrange polynomial that passes through the element nodes. The nodes are localized on the endpoint of an interval, \(\xi\in[-1,1]\) and the roots of the first derivative of Legendre polynomial of degree \(p-1\) (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:nodes})).

\begin{eqnarray}
(1-\xi^2)P'_{p-1}(\xi)=0
\label{eq:nodes}
\end{eqnarray}

The approximation of an integral over the elements is achieved according to Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) rule at points coinciding with the element nodes, 
and the weights \(w=w(\xi)\) calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
{w(\xi)} = \frac{2}{p(p-1)(P_{p-1}(\xi))^2}
\label{eq:weights}
\end{eqnarray}
This approach guarantees a diagonal mass matrix.
The shape functions and the weights for 2D or 3D elements are obtained by the Kronecker product of vectors of individual axes, denoted by \(\otimes\) as follow:
\begin{eqnarray}
N(\xi,\eta) = N(\xi)\otimes N(\eta), & N(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = N(\xi)\otimes N(\eta)\otimes N(\zeta) \nonumber\\
w(\xi,\eta) = w(\xi)\otimes w(\eta), & w(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = w(\xi)\otimes w(\eta)\otimes w(\zeta) 
\label{eq:3Dshape_weights}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{2D spectral modeling}
\label{sec:2D_SEM}

According to the first-order shear deformation theory~\cite{reissner1945effect, mindlin1951influence} the vector of displacements is expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{v}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{w}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)
\end{array} \right] = 
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}_0^e(\xi,\eta) + z\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e(\xi,\eta)\\
\textbf{v}_0^e(\xi,\eta) + z\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e(\xi,\eta)\\
\textbf{w}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\end{array} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{u}_0^e\), \(\textbf{v}_0^e\) and \(\textbf{w}_0^e\) denote the displacements of a point on the mid-plane, \(\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e\), \(\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e\) are the rotations of the normal to the mid-plane with respect to axes \textit{x} and \textit{y}, respectively.
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\textbf{v}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\textbf{w}_0^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_x^e(\xi,\eta) \\
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_y^e(\xi,\eta)
\end{array} \right]
& = & \textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta)\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e\nonumber\\
& = & \sum_{n=1}^q\sum_{m=1}^p\textbf{N}_m^e(\xi)\textbf{N}_n^e(\eta)
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\widehat{\textbf{u}}_0^e \\
\widehat{\textbf{v}}_0^e \\
\widehat{\textbf{w}}_0^e \\
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}_x^e \\
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}_y^e
\end{array} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
The bending strain components can be written as~\cite{ferreira2008matlab}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_b^e(\xi,\eta)=\textbf{B}_b^e\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{B}_b^e\) is the curvature-displacement matrix calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{B}_b^e=\textbf{L}_b\textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{L}_b=\left [
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\frac{\partial }{\partial x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial y} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial y} & \frac{\partial }{\partial x} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\partial }{\partial x} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\partial }{\partial y} & -\frac{\partial }{\partial x}
\end{array} \right],\ \\
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial y}
\end{array} \right] =\textbf{J}^{-1}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial }{\partial \xi}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial \eta}
\end{array} \right], \ 
\textbf{J}=\left [
\begin{array}{cc}
\partial_\xi x & {\partial_\xi y} \\
\partial_\eta x & {\partial_\eta y}
\end{array} \right] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The shear strain components can be written as~\cite{ferreira2008matlab}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_s^e(\xi,\eta)=\textbf{B}_s^e\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{B}_s^e\) is the curvature-displacement matrix calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{B}_s^e=\textbf{L}_s\textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{L}_s=\left [
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial x} & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial y} & 0 & -1
\end{array} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{3D model of the PZT transducer}
\label{sec:3D_SEM}
The displacements of the PZT transducer are defined by three displacement components \textbf{u}, \textbf{v} and \textbf{w}, and can be express in a form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{v}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \\
\textbf{w}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)
\end{array} \right]
& = & \textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta, \zeta)\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e\nonumber\\
& = & \sum_{l=1}^r\sum_{n=1}^q\sum_{m=1}^p\textbf{N}_m^e(\xi)\textbf{N}_n^e(\eta)\textbf{N}_l^e(\zeta)
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
\widehat{\textbf{u}}^e(\xi_m,\eta_n,\zeta_l) \\
\widehat{\textbf{v}}^e(\xi_m,\eta_n,\zeta_l) \\
\widehat{\textbf{w}}^e(\xi_m,\eta_n,\zeta_l)
\end{array} \right]
\label{eq:3D_displ}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\widehat{\textbf{u}}^e\), \(\widehat{\textbf{v}}^e\) and 
\(\widehat{\textbf{w}}^e\) are nodal values.
Six components of the strain matrix are approximated as follow \cite{kudela20093d}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)=\textbf{B}_{d}^e\widehat{\textbf{d}}^e
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{B}_{d}^e\) is strain-nodal displacement matrix calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{B}_{d}^e=\textbf{L}\textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{L}=\left [
\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial }{\partial x} & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial y} & 0\\
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\\
0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial z} & \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial z} & 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial y} & \frac{\partial }{\partial x} & 0
\end{array} \right],\ 
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\end{array} \right] =\textbf{J}^{-1}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial }{\partial \xi}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial \eta}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta}
\end{array} \right], \ 
\textbf{J}=\left [
\begin{array}{ccc}
\partial_\xi x & {\partial_\xi y} & {\partial_\xi z}\\
\partial_\eta x & {\partial_\eta y} & {\partial_\eta z}\\
\partial_\zeta x & {\partial_\zeta y} & {\partial_\zeta z}
\end{array} \right]
\end{eqnarray}

The electromechanical coupling is governed by the linear constitutive equation of piezoelectric material according to~\cite{giurgiutiumicromechatronics} and it is expressed by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ 
\begin {array}{c}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}\\
\textbf{D}
\end{array}\right ]=
\left [ 
\begin{array}{cc}
\textbf{c}^E & -\textbf{e}^T \\
\textbf{e} & \epsilon^S 
\end{array} \right ]
\left[ 
\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{S}\\
\textbf{E} 
\end{array} \right ]
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{c}^E\), \textbf{e} and \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^S\) are tensors of elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric constants, respectively, \textbf{E} and \textbf{D} are the electric field and electric displacement, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) and \textbf{S} are stress and strain.
The superscripts E and S indicate that quantities are measured at zero electric fields and zero strain, respectively and the subscript T denotes transpose matrix.
Electric field vector can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{E}^e=-\textbf{B}_\phi^e \widehat{\phi}^e
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{B}_\phi^e\) is the electric-nodal potential matrix calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{B}_\phi^e=
\left[ \begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial }{\partial \xi}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial \eta}\\
\frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta}
\end{array} \right]\textbf{N}^e(\xi,\eta,\zeta)
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Displacements coupling at the substructures interface}
\label{sec:interface}
The present model of the sandwich panel consists of 2D and 3D elements. 
Moreover, there are non-matching grids between two adjacent substructures. 
These involve connecting them by imposing the compatibility of the displacements at the interface, see Fig.~\ref{fig:interface}.
This type of connection is implemented by means of interface elements based on Lagrange multipliers, which are interpreted as forces responsible for determining the appropriate displacements of nodes.
The coupling can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}\\
\textbf{v}\\
\textbf{w}
\end{array}\right\}_{s_{i1}}^{\Gamma^i}-
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}\\
\textbf{v}\\
\textbf{w}
\end{array}\right\}_{s_{i2}}^{\Gamma^i}=
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{0}\\
\textbf{0}\\
\textbf{0}
\end{array}\right\}
\label{eq:coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/interface_2D3D.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Non-matching interface setup: a) interface coupling, b) degrees-of-freedom of the interface and the substructures, c) the nodes of the 3D substructure, d) interface nodes inherited from 3D substructure, e) interface nodes projection on 2D substructure, f) the nodes of the 2D substructure}
	\label{fig:interface}
\end{figure}
where \(s_{i1}\) and \(s_{i2}\) are substructures connected by the interface \(\Gamma^i\). For the whole structure, equation~\ref{eq:coupling} can be written in the matrix form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{G}\textbf{d}=\textbf{0}
\label{eq:cond_disp}
\end{eqnarray}
where \textbf{G} is the coupling matrix which contains the equations to interpolate the substructures displacements at the interfaces, and \(\textbf{d}\) is a global vector of displacements for \(nS\) number of substructures, composed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{d} = \left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
\textbf{d}_1, & \textbf{d}_2, &\ldots, & \textbf{d}_{nS}
\end{array}\right\}^T
\label{eq:displacements}
\end{eqnarray}

The general formulation of the matrix \textbf{G} is proposed in Algorithm \ref{alg:G_matrix}.
The main task of the algorithm is to calculate shape functions for each adjacent substructures at the points \(X_p=(x_p^k,y_p^k)\), which are projections of the interface nodes onto these substructures.
The shape function can be calculated after finding an owner element and local coordinates of the points.
Owner element is a spectral element in the domain of the substructure \(s_{ij}\) which contains interface node, for example, interface node \(k=6\) (see~Fig.~\ref{fig:interface}a)) is located in element \(e^I\) and \(e^{III}\) for the substructures \(s_{i1}\) and \(s_{i2}\), respectively.
It can be found within two ways: using Matlab's built-in function \verb+inpolygon+ or more efficient procedure proposed by Silva et al. \cite{silva2009exact} which was used in the current implementation.
The transformation from global to local coordinates was realized by the iterative method presented in the work of Li et al.~\cite{li2014efficient}.

where \(nI\) and \(nS\) are numbers of the interfaces and the structures, respectively; \(n^{\Gamma^i}\) and \(n^{s_{ij}}\) are numbers of nodes of the interface \(i\), and the structure \(s_{ij}\), respectively; \(\eta^k_p\) and  \(\xi^k_p\) are local coordinates of \(X_p\), respectively; \(J_{\kappa}\) are Jacobians evaluated at \((\xi_{\kappa+1},\eta_{\kappa+1})\) and \(N(\xi_{\kappa+1},\eta_{\kappa+1})\) is the shape function evaluated at \((\xi_{\kappa+1},\eta_{\kappa+1})\), \(nX_e\) is the vector of global order numbers of all nodes in the \(ownerElements^{s_{ij}}_k\), \(h_{ij}\) is a thickness of the structure \(s_{ij}\) and \(tol\) is a termination criterion for iterations.
The computational effectiveness of Algorithm~\ref{alg:G_matrix} can be easily improved if certain precautions are taken.
Firstly, the mesh of the interface has to be based on the mesh from one of the substructures \(s_i1\), \(s_i2\), which may be referred to as a slave.
So, the shape function takes only the values of one and zeros.
Moreover, the code can be implemented in vectorized form rather than using a for-loops.

\subsection{Elementary governing equations of motion}
\label{sec:motion}
The elementary governing equations of motion with Lagrange multipliers can be written in the matrix form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\textbf{M}_{dd} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
\left \{
\begin{array}{c}
\ddot{\widehat{\textbf{d}}}\\
\ddot{\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}}\\
0
\end{array} \right \}+
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\textbf{C}_{dd} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
\left \{
\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\widehat{\textbf{d}}}\\
\dot{\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}}\\
0
\end{array} \right \}+\nonumber\\
+\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\textbf{K}_{dd} & \textbf{K}_{d\phi} & {\textbf{G}}^T\\
\textbf{K}_{\phi d} & \textbf{K}_{\phi \phi} & 0\\
\textbf{G} & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
\left \{
\begin{array}{c}
\widehat{\textbf{d}}\\
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\\
\boldsymbol{\lambda}
\end{array} \right \}=
\left \{
\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{F}\\
\textbf{Q}\\
0
\end{array} \right \}
\label{eq:motion}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{M}_{dd}\), \(\textbf{C}_{dd}\), \(\textbf{K}_{dd}\) are structural mass, damping and stiffness matrices, respectively; \(\textbf{K}_{\phi d}={\textbf{K}_{d\phi}}^T\) are piezoelectric coupling matrix; \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}\) is the dielectric permittivity matrix, \(\widehat{\textbf{d}}\) is the nodal displacements and \(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\) is the electric potential; \(\textbf{F}\) the nodal external force vector, \(\textbf{Q}\) is the nodal externally applied charge vector, \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) is the vector of Lagrange multipliers, and \(\textbf{G}\) is the Lagrange multiplier matrix; \((\dot{\ })=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\).
The formulae of the matrices are provided in App.~\ref{app:matrices}.
The coupling is realized by imposing the traction forces, represented by a vector of Lagrange multipliers. 

\subsection{Transformation of the core elements}
\label{sec:transformation}
All core elements are rotated relative to both skins, so it is necessary to transform degrees of freedom from the local core's coordinate system to the global system.
For this purpose, an additional sixth global dof has been incorporated, i.e. rotation with respect to the z-axis.
Firstly, a part of mass matrix accounted for rotary inertia (see App. \ref{app:matrices}) is globalised as follow:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{M}_R^g=\textbf{a}\,\textbf{M}_R^l\,\textbf{a}^{-1}
\label{eq:inertia}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{a}\) is general rotation matrix obtained from multiplication of basic rotation matrices, and for the regular hexagonal core a is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{a}=\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
m & -n & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1\\
n & m & 0\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:rotation}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(m=\cos(\alpha),\:n=\sin(\alpha)\), for \(\alpha\in{[0^\circ,\,60^\circ,\,120^\circ,180^\circ,\,240^\circ,\,300^\circ]}\) depending on which wall of the cell it is applied to.

The stiffness--strain relationship in local and global coordinate systems is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^l_{11}\\
\sigma^l_{22}\\ 
\sigma^l_{33}\\ 
\sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{c}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^l_{11}\\
\epsilon^l_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^l_{33}\\
\gamma^l_{23}\\
\gamma^l_{13}\\
\gamma^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ], & and &
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\bar{\textbf{c}}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^g_{11}\\
\epsilon^g_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^g_{33}\\
\gamma^g_{23}\\
\gamma^g_{13}\\
\gamma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\end{array}
\label{eq:stress_global}
\end{eqnarray}
The global form of stiffness matrix \(K\), involves the determination of stiffness tensor \(\bar{c}\) from Eq.~\ref{eq:stress_global}.
The transformation of the stress tensor is expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^g_{11} & \sigma^g_{12} & \sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{21} & \sigma^g_{22} & \sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{31} & \sigma^g_{32} & \sigma^g_{33}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
=
\textbf{a}\,
\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^l_{11} & \sigma^l_{12} & \sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{21} & \sigma^l_{22} & \sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{31} & \sigma^l_{32} & \sigma^l_{33}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\,\textbf{a}^T
\label{eq:sigma_tensor}
\end{eqnarray}
After multiplication of matrices and using the symmetry of the stress tensor Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tensor} can be rewritten in a simplified form:

\begin{eqnarray}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{T}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^l_{11}\\
\sigma^l_{22}\\ 
\sigma^l_{33}\\
\sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:stress}
\end{eqnarray}

Analogously, strain relationship also is given in the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^g_{11}\\
\epsilon^g_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^g_{33}\\ 
\epsilon^g_{23}\\
\epsilon^g_{13}\\
\epsilon^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{T}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^l_{11}\\
\epsilon^l_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^l_{33}\\
\epsilon^l_{23}\\
\epsilon^l_{13}\\
\epsilon^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ], & and & \left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon_{11}\\
\epsilon_{22}\\ 
\epsilon_{33}\\ 
\gamma_{23}\\
\gamma_{13}\\
\gamma_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{R}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon_{11}\\
\epsilon_{22}\\ 
\epsilon_{33}\\
\epsilon_{23}\\
\epsilon_{13}\\
\epsilon_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\end{array}
\label{eq:strain}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{R}\) is the Reuter's matrix, defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{R} = \left [
\begin{array}{cccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:reuters}
\end{eqnarray}
Using the Eqs.~\ref{eq:rotation} through \ref{eq:reuters} the relationship of stress--strain in the global frame can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{T}\,\textbf{c}\,\textbf{R}\,\textbf{T}^{-1}\,\textbf{R}^{-1}\,
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^g_{11}\\
\epsilon^g_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^g_{33}\\
\gamma^g_{23}\\
\gamma^g_{13}\\
\gamma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:stress-strain}
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, transformed stiffness tensor for the core's elements is equal:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{\textbf{c}}=\textbf{T}\,\textbf{c}\,\textbf{R}\,\textbf{T}^{-1}\,\textbf{R}^{-1}
\label{eq:c_global}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{Time integration of the equation of motion}
\label{sec:time_integration}
Using the central difference scheme, equation (\ref{eq:motion}) can be rewritten as follow:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left(\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}+\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd} \right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_{t+\Delta t}=
\textbf{F}_t+\textbf{K}_s\boldsymbol{\phi}_t^P-\left( \textbf{K}_{dd}-\textbf{K}_a\right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_t\nonumber\\
+\frac{2}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}\widehat{\textbf{d}}_t-\left(\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}-\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd}\right)\widehat{\textbf{d}}_{t-\Delta t}-\textbf{G}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t
\label{eq:CDE}
\end{eqnarray}
where  \(\textbf{K}_s=\textbf{K}_{d\phi}^A{\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,A}}^{-1}\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,P}-\textbf{K}_{d\phi}^P\), \(\textbf{K}_a=\textbf{K}_{d \phi}^A{\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,A}}^{-1}\textbf{K}_{\phi d}^A\), and \(\Delta t\) is the time increment.
\(\textbf{K}_{d \phi}^A\) and \(\textbf{K}_{d\phi}^P\) are sub-matrices of matrix \(\textbf{K}_{d\phi}\), while \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,P}\) and \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,A}\) are the sub-matrices of matrix \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}\).
Their formulation is realized by discarding appropriate rows and columns according to imposed electrical boundary conditions.
\(\textbf{K}_{d \phi}^P\) contains columns selected from \(\textbf{K}_{d\phi}\) by vector \textbf{P}, and \(\textbf{K}_{d\phi}^A\) contains columns selected from \(\textbf{K}_{d\phi}\) by vector \textbf{A}.
\(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,P}\) contains columns from \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}\) selected by vector \textbf{P} and rows from the same matrix selected by vector \textbf{A}, and \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}^{A,A}\) contains rows and columns selected from \(\textbf{K}_{\phi \phi}\) by vector \textbf{A}.
Where \textbf{P} is a list of nodes assigned to the electrodes, and \textbf{A} is a complement of \textbf{P} in the set of all nodes of the PZT.

Unknown vector of Lagrange multipliers \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t\) is dependent on the load acting on the structure, and it is calculated for each time step from Eq.~(\ref{eq:CDE}) by imposing the constraint Eq.~(\ref{eq:cond_disp}).
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t = {\left(\textbf{G}\textbf{L}_+^{-1}\textbf{G}^T \right)}^{-1}\textbf{G}\textbf{L}_+^{-1} \Bigg[ \textbf{F}_t+\textbf{K}_s\boldsymbol{\phi}_t^P+\left.\left(\frac{2}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}-\textbf{K}_{dd}+\textbf{K}_a\right)\textbf{d}_t -\textbf{L}_-\textbf{u}_{t-\Delta t} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{L}_+=\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}+\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd}\) and \(\textbf{L}_-=\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\textbf{M}_{dd}-\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\textbf{C}_{dd}\).

\section{Numerical simulations}
\label{sec:numerical}
\subsection{Sample configuration}
\label{sec:sample}
The sample consists of aluminum honeycomb attached between two carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates by the adhesive layers (Fig.~\ref{fig:honeycomb}a)).
Material properties used in the simulations are gathered in App.~\ref{app:properties}.
One pair of circular PZT transducers were mounted on the top skin to generate and receive GW signals.
A glue layer under transducers was not considered.

In the middle of the structure, the circular area of the adhesive layer between the bottom skin and the core was removed to simulate the disbonds in the HSC.
This model is simple for implementation and does not affect the convergence of the time integration algorithm.
However, it does not take into account the contact between the structures, so the nodes of particular elements in this area may interpenetrate.
The size of the disbonds was the subject of the parametric study aiming at finding the damage effect on GW propagation.

The following dimensions and parameters were assumed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CFRP skins --- L = 500, W = 314, H = 1 mm, fibers volume fraction 
	50\%, stacking sequence 
	\([0^\circ,90^\circ,0^\circ,90^\circ,0^\circ,90^\circ,0^\circ,90^\circ]\),
	\item Core --- \(\Phi\) = 19, h = 10, w = 0.07 mm 
	(Fig.~\ref{fig:honeycomb}b)),
	\item Adhesive --- L = 500, W = 314, H = 0.5 mm,
	\item PZT --- \(\Phi\) = 10, h = 0.5 mm, location \#1 \((x_1,y_1)=(-80,0)\) 
	mm,	\#2 \((x_2,y_2)=(80,0)\) mm,
	\item Disbonds \(\Phi = \left [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 \right ]\).
\end{itemize}

	\caption{Sample configuration: a) top view of the sample, b) honeycomb sandwich substructures, c) detail of the honeycomb cell}
	\label{fig:honeycomb}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation parameters}
\label{sec:simulation}
The present model is composed of \(4 \times 4\) and \(4 \times 4 \times 4\) node spectral elements for 2D and 3D components, respectively.
To decrease the number of non-zero values of the \(\textbf{G}\)~matrix, the following steps had been taken during the preparation of the mesh.
One spectral element covers the wall of the honeycomb core, while the meshes of the skin plates and the adhesive layers were divided by elements in the shape of a rhombus, three per area under each cell.
In this way, the interface nodes coincide with the nodes lying on the hexagon edges (thick line on Fig. \ref{fig:skin_mesh} b)).
In the case of PZT transducers, the mesh was generated by using external GMSH software \cite{geuzaine2009gmsh} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:skin_mesh} c)).
The prepared meshes ensure at least 6 nodes per wavelength.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/skin_mesh.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The mesh with the nodes distribution, a) spectral element of the core's wall, b) excerpt of the skin plate, c) top view of the PZT transducer mesh}
	\label{fig:skin_mesh}
\end{figure}
The analysis was conducted with the wide bandwidth chirp signal (Fig.~\ref{fig:chirp}).
Total calculation time was set to 2 ms with time increment \(\Delta t=10\) ns.
The assigned excitation signal had the significant values in frequency domain between 0 and 20 kHz with resolution of 500 Hz.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/chirp_0_20.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Chirp signal}
	\label{fig:chirp}
\end{figure}
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The wave propagating through the sample interact with damage boundary, so the amplitude of the transmitted wave is expected to vary according to the size of the failure.
One can observe on the Fig. \ref{fig:wavefield} that only a portion of the wave reached the sensor, while part of the wave is entrapped within the damage.
Besides, the wave also interacts with the cells, because each cell in the core was modelled individually.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/wavefield.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Full wavefield}
	\label{fig:wavefield}
\end{figure}

To determine the effect of the damage size on GW propagation, the signal obtained by the sensor was taken into account.
The signal represents an average value of the electrical potential of the nodes belonging to the upper layer of the sensor, calculated in each time step for different damage diameter.
For further analysis, the time domain characteristics were transformed to frequency domain by the discrete Fourier transform, \(\Psi_S(f)=DFT(\Psi_S(t))\).
It can be noticed on the Fig. \ref{fig:signals}a) that the signal amplitudes do not always decrease with increasing the damage diameter.
Therefore, to determine the MADIF, the frequency \(f_i\) was chosen from among the full excitation range for which the function is monotonous. Thus, the MADIF is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
I = \Psi_S(f_i,d)
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/mgntPhiFFT.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The sensor signal in frequency domain a) full excitation bandwidth, b) bandwidth \#1, c) bandwidth \#2}
	\label{fig:signals}
\end{figure}
This assumption is fulfilled by the frequency \(f_1=16.0\) and \(f_2=16.5\) kHz (Fig. \ref{fig:signals}c)).
The MADIF (blue, solid line on Fig. \ref{fig:madif}) was aproximated by the polynomial interpolation of the amplitudes in frequency 16.5 kHz (red, x marks on Fig. \ref{fig:madif}) obtained in the simulations. 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/madif.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Model-assisted damage identify function for 16.5 kHz}
	\label{fig:madif}
\end{figure}
Normalized values of the MADIF are within a wide range, i.e. 0.2–1.0, which has a positive impact on the accuracy of the severity of damage indication.
This function can be used to identify damage to the physical sample associated with the model.
The severity of the failure shall be read from the determined characteristic for the value of the sensor voltage which has been measured according to the simulation scheme.
\clearpage
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
This paper presents preliminary research on the possibility of using a model-assisted approach to identify the severity of damage in a composite structure using GW propagation.
For this purpose the HSC panel model has been implemented with the actual geometry of the honeycomb core.
In contrast to  full structure homogenization, which is the most common HSC model found in the literature, the interaction of propagating wave with core cell walls is visible in the current model.
Moreover, the model is computationally efficient due to the use of SEM and 2D elements.

In the future works, the model will be adapted to parallel calculations using a multi-core graphics card, which will further reduce solution time. Experimental research will also be conducted to test the proposed method on physical samples.
