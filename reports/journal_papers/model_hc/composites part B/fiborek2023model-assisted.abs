^^IThis study aims to assess the debonding of the carbon skin from the honeycomb core in the sandwich panel based on guided wave propagation.
^^IThe effect of damage on wave propagation in the panel was determined using numerical simulations.
^^IThe two most common honeycomb core models found in the literature are a homogenized, orthogonal continuous medium and a real geometry core modelled by finite elements, usually using commercial software.
^^IIn a simplified model, the results are in good agreement only for low frequencies.
^^IIn this paper, the panel wad modelled by the time-domain spectral element method taking into account the real geometry of the honeycomb core.
^^IThe presented model was compared with the homogenized model of the
^^IThe result of the parametric study is a function of damage influence on the amplitude of propagating waves.
