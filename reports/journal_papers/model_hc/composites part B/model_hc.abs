	This study aims to assess the debonding of the carbon skin from the honeycomb core in the sandwich panel based on guided wave propagation.
	The effect of damage on wave propagation in the slab was determined using numerical simulations.
	The two most common honeycomb core models found in the literature are a homogenized, orthogonal continuous medium and a real geometry core modelled by finite elements, usually using commercial software.
	In a simplified model, the results are in good agreement only for low frequencies.
	In this paper, the panel has been modelled by the time-domain spectral element method taking into account the real geometry of the honeycomb core.
	
	The presented model was compared with the homogenized model of the
	The result of the parametric study is a function of damage influence on the amplitude of propagating waves.
