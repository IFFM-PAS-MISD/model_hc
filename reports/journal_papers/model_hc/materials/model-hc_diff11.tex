\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Honeycomb Sandwich Composite~(HSC) is a type of multi-layered structure, which is composed of the mid-core with the geometry of honeycomb sandwiched between thin skins.
They are widely used in the aerospace, marine and automotive industries due to the high strength-to-weight ratio, high energy absorption capability and effective acoustic insulation.
However, these complex structures are exposed to various types of damage that are not found in metal alloy materials, e.g. hidden disbonds between the skin and the core, delamination of the skin plates, or the core impact damage.
They can occur either during a manufacturing process, storage or in-service life.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Because of this}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Therefore}\DIFaddend , advanced methods are required for on-line damage detections.

The structural health monitoring (SHM) method with very high potential is the method based on the Guided Wave (GW) propagation \cite{mustapha2011assessment, sikdar2016guided, sikdar2016ultrasonic,radzienski2016assessment, yu2019core}.
GW are mechanical waves that propagate in a bounded, elastic medium, e.g. bars, beams, rods, plates and shells.
The wavelength of GW is longer than the thickness of the bounding elastic medium.
An excitation and sensing of the GW can be realised by the lightweight and inexpensive piezoelectric transducers (PZT) \cite{giurgiutiumicromechatronics}.
The compact PZT can be surface-bonded to the inspected structure or even embedded between the composite plies so that the measurements can be conducted in situ.
Among numerous techniques developed for damage detection and localisation, the most popular are pitch--catch \cite{ihn2008pitch, sikdar2017structural}, pulse--echo \cite{guo1993interaction, kudela2008damage}, phase array \cite{lu2006crack, ostachowicz2008elastic}, and time-reversal mirror \cite{fink1992time, eremin2016analytically}.

The most common numerical modelling of the phenomenon of GW in HSC found in the literature is a calculation of the effective material properties of the honeycomb structure by the homogenisation process~\cite{shi1995derivation, qi2008ultrasonic, mustapha2014leaky, baid2015dispersion, sikdar2016guided}.
However, this method is not able to adequately present the phenomenon of propagation of elastic waves in such material.
A more accurate model will be achieved if the real geometry of the hexagonal cell is retained.

Ruzzenne et al. presented a parametric study to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the honeycomb and cellular structures through the finite element model and the application of the theory of periodic structures \cite{ruzzene2003wave}.
Recently, the simulations of the wave propagation in the HSC have been conducted with the commercially available finite element code~\cite{song2009guided, hosseini2013numerical, tian2015wavenumber, zhao2018wave}.
However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{finite element simulations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the finite element method }\DIFaddend (FEM) of GW are inefficient as they require a significant amount of memory and are time-consuming.

The computational efficiency of the FEM in case of GW modelling in the HSC can be improved by using the time-domain spectral element method (SEM).
The SEM was originally used for the numerical solution of the fluid--flow in a channel by Patera \cite{patera1984spectral} but has also been successfully developed for elastic wave propagation~\cite{ostachowicz2011guided}.
Kudela proposed a model of the GW in HSC by the parallel implementation of the SEM \cite{kudela2016parallel}.
However, this model had a large number \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(1.5 million) }\DIFaddend of degrees-of-freedom (DOF), because cells of the core and skin plate were modelled by the three-dimensional (3D) spectral elements.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Therefore}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Although}\DIFaddend , the simulation was limited to only one skin plate and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend small dimension of the HSC (\(179 \times 159 \) mm).

Above mentioned drawbacks were motivation to propose a new model of the HSC. In the present paper, the skin plates, adhesive layers and each wall of the hexagonal core were modelled by two-dimensional (2D) spectral elements.
However, 2D elements have nodes only in a mid-plane, therefore, there is no direct connection between the two adjacent structures.
This connection was implemented by interface elements based on Lagrange multipliers \cite{ashwin2014formulation, fiborek20192d}.
Additionally, the signal was generated and recorded with piezoelectric transducers (PZT), while Kudela excited the waves with an external force applied at the point of the panel \cite{kudela2016parallel}.
A non-matching interface between the transducers and the skin was used to avoid too complex mesh, likewise to the interfaces developed for the FEM \cite{flemisch2000elasto, flemisch2012non}. To the best of authors’
knowledge, it has not been implemented for the SEM.

The parametric study conducted in the paper leads to the determination of a model-assisted damage identification function (MADIF), which determines the influence of the size of the composite defect on wave propagation.
In this case, the defect is assumed to be a disbond between the skin and the core.

\section{The time-domain spectral element method formulation}
\label{sec:time_SEM}
\subsection{The spectral element method}
\label{sec:sem}
The general concept of the SEM is based on the idea of the FEM.
The similarity of both methods lies in the fact that the modelled domain is divided into non-overlapping finite elements, and external forces and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed in the particular nodes.
The main difference between those methods is a choice of the shape function \( N=N(\xi )\), which is interpolated by Lagrange polynomial that passes through the element nodes. The nodes are localized on the endpoint of an interval, \(\xi\in[-1,1]\) and the roots of the first derivative of Legendre polynomial of degree \(p-1\):

\begin{eqnarray}
(1-\xi^2)P'_{p-1}(\xi)=0
\label{eq:nodes}
\end{eqnarray}

The approximation of an integral over the elements is achieved according to Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) rule at points coinciding with the element nodes, 
and the weights \(w=w(\xi)\) calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
{w(\xi)} = \frac{2}{p(p-1)(P_{p-1}(\xi))^2}
\label{eq:weights}
\end{eqnarray}
This approach guarantees a diagonal mass matrix.
The shape functions and the weights for 2D or 3D elements are obtained by the Kronecker product of vectors of individual axes, denoted by \(\otimes\) as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
N(\xi,\eta) = N(\xi)\otimes N(\eta), & N(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = N(\xi)\otimes N(\eta)\otimes N(\zeta) \nonumber\\
w(\xi,\eta) = w(\xi)\otimes w(\eta), & w(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = w(\xi)\otimes w(\eta)\otimes w(\zeta) 
\label{eq:3Dshape_weights}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Displacements coupling at the substructures interface}
\label{sec:interface}
The present model of the sandwich panel consists of 2D and 3D elements. 
Moreover, there are non-matching grids between two adjacent substructures. 
These involve connecting them by imposing the compatibility of the displacements at the interface, see Fig.~\ref{fig:interface}.
This type of connection is implemented through the interface elements based on Lagrange multipliers, which are interpreted as forces responsible for determining the appropriate displacements of nodes.
The coupling can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}\\
\textbf{v}\\
\textbf{w}
\end{array}\right\}_{s_{i1}}^{\Gamma^i}-
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{u}\\
\textbf{v}\\
\textbf{w}
\end{array}\right\}_{s_{i2}}^{\Gamma^i}=
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\textbf{0}\\
\textbf{0}\\
\textbf{0}
\end{array}\right\}
\label{eq:coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../figures/eps/interface_2D3D.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Non-matching interface setup: a) interface coupling, b) degrees-of-freedom of the interface and the substructures, c) the nodes of the 3D substructure, d) interface nodes inherited from 3D substructure, e) interface nodes projection on the 2D substructure, f) the nodes of the 2D substructure}
	\label{fig:interface}
\end{figure}
where \(s_{i1}\) and \(s_{i2}\) are substructures connected by the interface \(\Gamma^i\). For the whole structure, the Eq.~\ref{eq:coupling} can be written in the matrix form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{G}\textbf{d}=\textbf{0}
\label{eq:cond_disp}
\end{eqnarray}
where \textbf{G} is the coupling matrix which contains the equations to interpolate the substructures displacements at the interfaces, and \(\textbf{d}\) is a global vector of displacements for \(nS\) number of substructures, composed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{d} = \left\{\begin{array}{cccc}

	\caption{Matrix G formulation}
	\label{alg:G_matrix}
\end{algorithm}
The general formulation of the matrix \textbf{G} is proposed in Algorithm \ref{alg:G_matrix}.
The main task of the algorithm is to calculate shape functions for each adjacent substructures at the points \(X_p=(x_p^k,y_p^k)\), which are projections of the interface nodes onto these substructures.
The shape function can be calculated after finding an owner element and local coordinates of the points.
Owner element is a spectral element in the domain of the substructure \(s_{ij}\) which contains interface node, for example, interface node \(k_\Gamma=36\) (see~Fig.~\ref{fig:interface}a)) is located in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend element \(e^{I}_{3D}\) and \(e^{III}_{2D}\) for the substructures \(s_{11}\) and \(s_{12}\), respectively.
It can be found within two ways: using Matlab's built-in function \verb+inpolygon+ or more efficient procedure proposed by Silva et al. \cite{silva2009exact} which was used in the current implementation.
The transformation from global to local coordinates was realised by the iterative method presented in the work of Li et al.~\cite{li2014efficient}.

The computational effectiveness of Algorithm~\ref{alg:G_matrix} can be easily improved if certain precautions are taken.
Firstly, the mesh of the interface has to be based on the mesh from one of the substructures \(s_i1\), \(s_i2\), which may be referred to as a slave.
So, the shape function takes only the values of one and zeros.
Moreover, the code can be implemented in vectorized form rather than using a for-loops.

\subsection{Transformation of the core elements}
\label{sec:transformation}
All core elements are rotated relative to both skins, so it is necessary to transform degrees of freedom from the local core's coordinate system to the global system.
For this purpose, an additional sixth global dof has been incorporated, i.e. rotation with respect to the z-axis.
Firstly, a part of the mass matrix accounted for rotary inertia (see App. \ref{app:matrices}) is globalised as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{M}_R^g=\textbf{a}\,\textbf{M}_R^l\,\textbf{a}^{-1}
\label{eq:inertia}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\textbf{a}\) is general rotation matrix obtained from the multiplication of basic rotation matrices, and for the regular hexagonal core a is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{a}=\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
m & -n & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1\\
n & m & 0\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\label{eq:rotation}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(m=\cos(\alpha),\:n=\sin(\alpha)\), for \(\alpha\in{[0^\circ,\,60^\circ,\,120^\circ,180^\circ,\,240^\circ,\,300^\circ]}\) depending on which wall of the cell it is applied to.

The stiffness--strain relationship in local and global coordinate systems is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^l_{11}\\
\sigma^l_{22}\\ 
\sigma^l_{33}\\ 
\sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]=
\textbf{c}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}

\epsilon^l_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^l_{33}\\
\gamma^l_{23}\\
\gamma^l_{13}\\

\end{array}
\right ], & and &
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{13}\\

\end{array}
\right ]=
\bar{\textbf{c}}\,\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon^g_{11}\\
\epsilon^g_{22}\\ 
\epsilon^g_{33}\\
\gamma^g_{23}\\
\gamma^g_{13}\\
\gamma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\end{array}
\label{eq:stress_global}
\end{eqnarray}
The global form of the stiffness matrix \(K\), involves the determination of stiffness tensor \(\bar{c}\) from Eq.~\ref{eq:stress_global}.
The transformation of the stress tensor is expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^g_{11} & \sigma^g_{12} & \sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{21} & \sigma^g_{22} & \sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{31} & \sigma^g_{32} & \sigma^g_{33}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
=
\textbf{a}\,
\left [ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^l_{11} & \sigma^l_{12} & \sigma^l_{13}\\
\sigma^l_{21} & \sigma^l_{22} & \sigma^l_{23}\\
\sigma^l_{31} & \sigma^l_{32} & \sigma^l_{33}\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\,\textbf{a}^T
\label{eq:sigma_tensor}
\end{eqnarray}
After the multiplication of matrices and using the symmetry of the stress tensor Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tensor} can be rewritten in a simplified form:

\begin{eqnarray}
\left [
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma^g_{11}\\
\sigma^g_{22}\\ 
\sigma^g_{33}\\ 
\sigma^g_{23}\\
\sigma^g_{13}\\
\sigma^g_{12}\\
\end{array}

\section{Numerical simulations}
\label{sec:numerical}
\subsection{Sample configuration}
\label{sec:sample}
The sample consists of aluminium honeycomb attached between two carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates by the adhesive layers (Fig.~\ref{fig:honeycomb}a)).
Material properties used in the simulations are gathered in App.~\ref{app:properties}.
One pair of circular PZT transducers were mounted on the top skin to generate and receive GW signals.
A glue layer under transducers was not considered.

The adhesive layer elements from a circular area of damage were removed from the model to simulate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend disbonds in the HSC\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

\cite{cerniglia20103d}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend The failure was placed in the structure centre, between the top skin and the core. 
This model is simple for implementation and does not affect the convergence of the time integration algorithm.
However, it does not take into account the contact between the structures, so the nodes of particular elements in this area may interpenetrate.
The size of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend disbonds was the subject of the parametric study aiming at finding the damage effect on GW propagation.

The following dimensions and parameters were assumed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CFRP skins --- L = 500, W = 314, H = 1 mm, fibers volume fraction 
	50\%, stacking sequence 
	\([0^\circ,90^\circ,0^\circ,90^\circ,0^\circ,90^\circ,0^\circ,90^\circ]\),
	\item Core --- \(\Phi\) = 19, h = 10, w = 0.07 mm 
	(Fig.~\ref{fig:honeycomb}b)),
	\item Adhesive --- L = 500, W = 314, H = 0.5 mm,
	\item PZT --- \(\Phi\) = 10, h = 0.5 mm, location \#1 \((x_1,y_1)=(-80,0)\) 
	mm,	\#2 \((x_2,y_2)=(80,0)\) mm,
	\item Disbonds \(\Phi = \left [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 \right ]\).
\end{itemize}

The orthotropic mechanical properties for aluminium core are gathered in Table \ref{tab:properties_eff}, while the properties for other structures, i.e. skins, adhesive layers and sensors remained unchanged.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The wave propagating through the sample had interacted with the damage boundary. The portion of the wave reached the sensor, while the part of the wave was entrapped within the damage.

\DIFadd{The advantage of the present model in comparison to the homogenised one can be immediately pointed out by analysis of the propagating wavefield (see Fig. \ref{fig:wavefield}).
The wavefield of the proposed model is much more realistic.
It reveals wave entrapment in the honeycomb cells.
Such an effect is not present in the homogenised model.
It also causes, that S0 to A0 mode conversion at sensor location is much more visible in the homogenised model (Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefield} left) than in the proposed model (Fig. \ref{fig:wavefield} right).
}

\DIFadd{It can be noticed in Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefield}) that the wave propagates in a manner typical for orthotropic material in case of both models, i.e. the wave velocity depends on the angle of propagation.
In addition to the material properties of skins, velocity profiles highly depend on the core properties.
This behaviour can be observed for both models.
The highest velocities of A0 and S0 mode are observed in $0^{\circ}$ direction, while the minimum values are for $45^{\circ}$ (see. }\DIFaddend Fig.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:wavefield}).
Besides, the wave also interacts with the cells, because each cell in the core was modelled individually}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:speed}).
The A0 mode velocities are significantly lower in the current model than in the homogenised one.
The differences are in a range from 12 to 29\%, and only up to 3\% for S0 mode.  
}

\DIFadd{In Fig.~\ref{fig:velocity} d) one can also notice differences in the particles velocity amplitude after the pulse has passed.
For that period, the amplitude of particle velocity \(V_z\) is 2.8 times higher for the present model, due to reflections of the wave within the core walls}\DIFaddend .

	\label{fig:madif}
\end{figure}
To determine the effect of the damage size on GW propagation, the signal obtained by the sensor was taken into account.
The signal represents an average value of the electrical potential of the nodes belonging to the upper layer of the sensor, calculated in each time step for different damage diameter.
For further analysis, the time domain characteristics were transformed to the frequency domain by the discrete Fourier transform, \(\Psi_S(f)=DFT(\Psi_S(t))\).
It can be noticed in Fig. \ref{fig:signals}a) that the signal amplitudes do not always decrease with increasing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{damage diameter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{diameter of the damage}\DIFaddend .
Therefore, to determine the MADIF, the frequency \(f_i\) was chosen from among the full excitation range for which the function is monotonous. Thus, the MADIF is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
I = \Psi_S(f_i,d)
\end{eqnarray}

This assumption is fulfilled by the frequency \(f_1=16.0\) and \(f_2=16.5\) kHz (Fig. \ref{fig:signals}c)).
The MADIF (blue, solid line on Fig. \ref{fig:madif}) was approximated by the polynomial interpolation of the amplitudes in the frequency 16.5 kHz (red, x marks on Fig. \ref{fig:madif}) obtained in the simulations. 

Normalized values of the MADIF are within a wide range, i.e. 0.2–1.0, which has a positive impact on the accuracy of the severity of damage indication.
This function can be used to identify damage to the physical sample associated with the model.
The severity of the failure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{shall be read from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is indicated on }\DIFaddend the determined characteristic for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{value of the sensor voltage , which has been measured according to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sensor voltage value, measured under }\DIFaddend the simulation scheme.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
This paper presents preliminary research on the possibility of using a model-assisted approach to identify the severity of damage in a composite structure using GW propagation.
For this purpose, the HSC panel model has been implemented with the actual geometry of the honeycomb core.
In contrast to  full structure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{homogenization}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{homogenisation}\DIFaddend , which is the most common HSC model found in the literature, the interaction of the propagating wave with core cell walls is visible in the current model.
Moreover, the model is computationally efficient due to the use of SEM and 2D elements.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The present model has 25 times less number of DOF than a full 3D model (according to \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kudela2016parallel}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, estimated no of DOF is twelve million) and only 1.2 more than the homogenised model.
}\DIFaddend 

In the future works, the model will be adapted to parallel calculations using a multi-core graphics card, which will further reduce solution time. Experimental research will also be conducted to test the proposed method on physical samples.
