\appendix

\section{Section title of first appendix\label{app1}}

Use \verb+\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}+ for program codes without math. Use \verb+\begin{alltt}...\end{alltt}+ for program codes with math. Based on the text provided inside the optional argument of \verb+\begin{code}[Psecode|Listing|Box|Code|+\hfill\break \verb+Specification|Procedure|Sourcecode|Program]...+ \verb+\end{code}+ tag corresponding boxed like floats are generated. Also note that \verb+\begin{code}[Code|Listing]...+ \verb+\end{code}+ tag with either Code or Listing text as optional argument text are set with computer modern typewriter font.  All other code environments are set with normal text font. Refer below example:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Descriptive Caption Text},label=DescriptiveLabel]
for i:=maxint to 0 do
begin
{ do nothing }
end;
Write('Case insensitive ');
WritE('Pascal keywords.');
\end{lstlisting}
