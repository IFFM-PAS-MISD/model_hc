This chapter describes the \ac{sem} implementation for use in \acp{hsc} with \ac{fcgm}.
This model requires the development of structural matrices for \ac{2d} and \ac{3d} elements and a transformation of the nodal displacements between the local and global systems.
An original approach was developed to connect elements with non-matching grids using an interface based on Lagrange multipliers.
For this purpose, the shape fusions of common points in the space of connected elements were determined to calculate the traction forces necessary to provide joint displacements.
In addition, a parallel central difference method implementation was optimized for even more efficient computation on the graphics card.
