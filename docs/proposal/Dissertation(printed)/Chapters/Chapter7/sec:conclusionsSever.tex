In this chapter, the \ac{madif} was determined by which the milestone of the dissertation was achieved.
For this purpose, six \acp{di} were analysed for two different models of the panel core and two models of the damage.
Among the six indices, the best two \acp{di} were selected to determine the \ac{madif} function.
Their characteristics are monotonically over the entire damage range and a significant change in the index value for the most extensive damage.
The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements.
The \ac{hcgm} proved inadequate for determining the \ac{madif}, as no \ac{di} reached an mean error of less than 20\% relative to the experimental measurements.
It demonstrates the confirmation of the thesis that it is possible to determine the damage severity function in \ac{hsc} by employing numerical simulations.
