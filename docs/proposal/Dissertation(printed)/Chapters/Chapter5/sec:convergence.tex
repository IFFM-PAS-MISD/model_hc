\subsection{Spatial convergence}
Spatial convergence was determined for samples with elements of different order of the Legendre polynomial (see Eq. (\ref{eq:nodes})).
The polynomials of order \(p=[4,\,5,\,7,\,9,\, 11]\) were considered for in-plane interpolation.
The exact polynomial order was assumed for each component to minimise the non-zero value of coupling matrix \(\textbf{G}\).
The thickness-wise nodes of the core elements, perpendicular to the wave propagation, were fixed to 4.
The percentage error was considered as a criterion for convergence:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\delta^{\mathrm{conv}} = \frac{\sum{\left(e^{\mathrm{max}}-e^{p}\right)^2}}{\sum{\left(e^{max}\right)^2}} \times 100\%,
	\label{eq:perc_err_conv}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(e^{max}\) and \(e^{p}\) are the signal envelopes for the case with the elements of \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\) polynomial order and the observed case, respectively.
A 5\% threshold was assumed for selecting the degree of the polynomial.
The signal envelope obtained using the Hilbert transform, which was discussed in relation to signal processing in the \ac{shm} by Staszewski et al. \cite{staszewski2004health} for signal processing, is given as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:hilbert}
	\hat{x}(t) &=& \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x(\tau)\frac{1}{t-\tau}\diff\tau,\\
	\label{eq:envelope}
	e(t) &=& \sqrt{x^2(t)+\hat{x}^2(t)}.
	\nomtypeD[e]{\(e(t)\)}{Signal envelope}{}%
	\nomtypeR[t]{\(t\)}{Time vector}{}{\unit{\second}}%
\end{eqnarray}

Figure \ref{fig:dx_conv}(\textbf{a}) shows the example of the simulated signals of 100 \unit{\kHz}.
Despite the good agreement of the wave speed for all cases, the amplitudes converge only for a polynomial of order 7.
Based on the graph in Figure \ref{fig:dx_conv}(\textbf{b}) showing simulation errors, the polynomial of order \(p=7\) was selected for 50 and 100 \unit{\kHz} signals, and order \(p=9\) was selected for the 150 \unit{\kHz} signal.
 
Table \ref{tab:elements_nodes} contains a complete list of elements with the number of nodes on each axis \(\xi\times \eta \times \zeta\) which were considered in simulations.

While the maximum length of the skin element is 6 \unit{\mm}, such a \ac{cfrp} model satisfies the condition of at least six nodes per wavelength for the \ac{a0}, as it is the shortest mode propagating in the assumed frequency range.
Table~\ref{tab:wavelength} shows the \ac{a0} wavelengths for various frequency and propagation angles.

\subsection{Temporal convergence}
A temporal convergence test was conducted to select the appropriate time step value.
The critical value of time increment (\(\Delta t_{cr}\)) depends on the mesh size and the wave mode velocity.
For the explicit time integration algorithm and in accordance with the Courant-Fredrichs-Levy convergence condition, the time step must be less than the ratio of \(\Delta x/c_p\), where \(\Delta x\) is the shortest distance between nodes and \(c_p\) is the phase velocity of the propagating wave.
While time step is set over (\(\Delta t_{cr}\)), the structure displacements increase to infinity immediately as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:dt_cr}.
It indicates that the time step has to be further decreased which can be easily implemented to verify the stability of the attempt.
