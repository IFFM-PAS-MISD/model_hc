The full wavefield in the healthy sample is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:fullfield_50_0}, Fig.~\ref{fig:fullfield_100_0} and Fig.~\ref{fig:fullfield_150_0}.
The experimental measurements and the \ac{fcgm} snapshots show that the wavefront distortion is rising with the frequency.
Because the wavelength decreases as the frequency increases, a higher frequency signal is more likely to induce wave reflections from the core walls.
This effect can not be observed in the case of the \ac{hcgm}.

In case of the damaged sample, the wavefront is not distorted in the damage area bounded by dashed white rectangle in Fig.~\ref{fig:fullfield_50_5}, Fig.~\ref{fig:fullfield_100_5} and Fig.~\ref{fig:fullfield_150_5} for all three cases.
Due to the lack of wave leakage into the core, the wave propagates smoothly through the skin.
For the experimental sample and the \ac{fcgm}, interference of waves reflected from the cells and the damage boundary is observed.
The wave interference observed in the \ac{hcgm} refers to waves reflected only from the defect.
