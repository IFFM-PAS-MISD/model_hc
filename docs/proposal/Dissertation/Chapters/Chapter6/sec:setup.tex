\end{figure}
The presented model of the \ac{hsc} was validated with results from two experimental studies.
The first one was performed for determination of the full wavefield of the propagating waves by the \ac{sldv} (Polytec PSVâ€“400).
The second study was performed for wave acquisition by the \ac{pzt} sensor.
A schematic of the experimental scenarios is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}.

The \ac{sldv} is a modern method for non-contact measurement of the vibration velocity of structure surface particles.
The principle of vibrometer operation is based on the Doppler effect, recording the change of frequency of the light beam reflected from the vibrating surface.
In laser vibrometry, the measurement of frequency change is realised by interferometer and analysis of both reference and measurement light beam.
The measuring system is additionally equipped with mirrors allowing to change the angle of the measuring beam, so it is possible to take measurements at a grid of points on a surface of inspected structural element automatically.
The \ac{sldv} setup is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:sldv}.

The \ac{pzt} elastic wave generation and acquisition system is used to measure the voltage changes of transducers due to their mechanical deformation.
It is a point measurement at the point of sensor placement.
The following instruments are required to make the measurements: waveform generator to prepare signal, amplifier to strengthen the excitation and recording signals, oscilloscope and central management unit.
The setup used for measurements is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pzt_setup}.

Both methods have some advantages and disadvantages, which are given in the Table~\ref{tab:method_comp}.

The sample was fabricated under workshop conditions from the components described in Section~\ref{sec:sample}.
Before applying the two-ingredient glue (Loctite EA3479B), the bottom surface of the skin was cleaned and degreased with the solvent (Loctite SF7063).
The adhesive curing took 48 hours under a distributed load at ambient temperature.

The subject of the parametric study was the effect of the disbond size on the propagating \ac{gw}.
After a reference measurement was made on an intact sample, several measurements were taken for the subsequent damage introduced on the same specimen.
The damage width varied in range \(\mathrm{w_d}=\left [10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 120 \right ]\) \unit{\mm}, while its fixed length was \(\mathrm{l_d} = 175\) \unit{\mm}.

The \(N_c=5\) cycle Hann windowed signal at carrier frequencies \(f_c=[50,100,150]\) \unit{\kHz} was generated using an arbitrary waveform generator (National Instruments, PXI 5413).
The signal was amplified 3.5 times and supplied to the \ac{pzt} actuator (Noliac, NCE51) by the emission/reception unit (LWDS, Cedrat Technologies).
Each measurement was conducted under a temperature of 20\unit{\degreeCelsius} controlled in the environmental chamber (DM 600C, Angelantoni Test Technologies Srl) and averaged 20~times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
