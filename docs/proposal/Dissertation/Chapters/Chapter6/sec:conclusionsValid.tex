This chapter presents the experimental validation of the present and homogenised model.
It is shown that the full core geometry model better expresses the wave propagation in \ac{hsc} than the simplified model.
The snapshots of the full-field propagation show wave interference in the core cells, which is impossible in the homogenised model.
The full-field analysis also showed a lack of wave leakage into the core at the damaged area.
This phenomenon will be the basis for determining the effect of the damage on wave propagation.
According to the \ac{pzt} measurement, the wave propagation speed of both models is good agreement with the accurate sample.
Additionally, it is shown that by optimising the algorithm for solving the equation of motion, a ten times faster computation time than the algorithm presented in \cite{kudela2020parallel} was obtained.
