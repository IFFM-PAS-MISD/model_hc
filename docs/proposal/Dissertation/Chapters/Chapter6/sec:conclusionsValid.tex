This chapter presents the experimental validation of the \ac{fcgm} and \ac{hcgm}.
It is shown that the \ac{fcgm} better expresses the wave propagation in \ac{hsc} than the simplified model.
The snapshots of the full wavefield show wave interference in the core cells, which is impossible in the \ac{hcgm}.
The full-field analysis also showed a lack of wave leakage into the core at the damaged area.
This phenomenon will be the basis for determining the effect of the damage on wave propagation.
The velocity of the wave propagation for both models is in good agreement with the \ac{pzt} measurements.
Additionally, it was shown that by optimising the algorithm for solving the equation of motion, a calculation time was achieved ten times faster than the algorithm presented in the paper \cite{kudela2020parallel}.
