\section{The \acs{madif} under variable temperature conditions}
\label{sec:madifTemp}

%% SECTION CONTENT ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In addition to the referenced \ac{madif} obtained for +20\unit{\degreeCelsius}, a study of wave propagation at temperatures T=\(\left[-10,\,0,\,+10,\,+30,\,+40,\,+50\right]\)\unit{\degreeCelsius} was carried out.
To determine temperature-dependent \ac{gw} propagation in \ac{hsc} using simulations, the material properties of the components were assumed according to the methodology described in section~\ref{sec:temp}.

The temperature effect on the \acp{madif} is developed based on the \ac{fcgm} and removed interface elements as a damage model.
The analysis used both \acp{di}, i.e. the \ac{rmsd} and the \ac{cc}, for the 100 \unit{\kHz} full-length signal.
The signals obtained for a healthy sample at considered temperatures were taken as the reference signals for each case.
As with the reference temperature, an analysis of the selection of the fitting function was performed.
The best results were obtained for Eq.~(\ref{eq:function_1}), and the function coefficients for each temperature are collected in the Tab.~\ref{tab:fit_F_err_temp}.

The temperature-dependent \acp{madif} based on \ac{rmsd} and \ac{cc} are presented in Fig.\ref{fig:madif_temp_rmsd} and Fig.~\ref{fig:madif_temp_cc}, respectively.
It is observed that the variation in ambient temperature condition can substantially influence the \ac{madif} values.
From Fig.~\ref{fig:madif_temp_rmsd}, it can be seen that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements for the ambient temperature over 0\unit{\degreeCelsius}.
The results obtained at 0\unit{\degreeCelsius} and -10\unit{\degreeCelsius} have a much larger error because the model-based functions tend to have a lower value than the experimental ones.
Therefore, the assumed linear model of the temperature-dependent material properties of the components used in the simulation is not sufficiently accurate with the real object.

In the case of the \ac{cc}, the best results were achieved at temperatures between +10\unit{\degreeCelsius} and +40\unit{\degreeCelsius}.
