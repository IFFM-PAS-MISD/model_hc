The dissertation results from the work of the author as an assistant in the Mechanics of Intelligent Structures Department, Institute of Fluid Flow Machinery, Polish Academy of Sciences.
Most of the work has been carried out within the framework of a research project, titled ‘Model-assisted damage identification function for Structural Health Monitoring of composite structures under a varied environmental condition’, which was awarded to the author by the National Science Centre.
The primary objective of the dissertation was to develop a new approach to a sandwich structure assessment based on guided waves techniques.
The essence of the proposed method is to establish an accurate and efficient numerical model of the wave propagation in the sandwich structure to determine the severity of the damage.
