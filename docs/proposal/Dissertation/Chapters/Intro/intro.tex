\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
The dissertation results from the author’s work as an assistant in the Department of Mechanics of Intelligent Structures, Institute of Fluid Flow Machinery, Polish Academy of Sciences.
Most of the work has been carried out within the framework of a research project titled ‘Model-assisted damage identification function for Structural Health Monitoring of composite structures under a varied environmental condition', which was granted to the author by the National Science Centre, Poland.
The primary objective was to develop a new approach to a sandwich structure assessment based on guided waves techniques under varied operating conditions.
The essence of the proposed method is to establish an accurate and numerically efficient model of the wave propagation in the sandwich structure to determine the severity of the damage.
A better understanding of guided wave behaviour in such structures and their interaction with damage will help develop more precise structural health monitoring strategies, reducing costs without compromising the safety of the liable systems.

%% SECTION CONTENT ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In the Introduction, a brief overview of problems undertaken in the dissertation has been presented, i.e., composite materials, construction and their applications;  definition of the \ac{shm} and application of \ac{pzt} sensors in damage detection; and challenges in \ac{gw} propagation modelling for damage severity assessment in the \acp{hsc}.
The most relevant issues address to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item flexibility to model complex structure of the honeycomb core;
	\item time efficiency due to the high number of \ac{dof} of the model;
	\item possibility to parallel calculation on the \ac{gpu}.
\end{itemize}
The literature review revealed the need for a practical tool for damage size estimation in the \acp{hsc} to increase the safe usage of the engineering structures made of composites. 
Therefore, in the dissertation, I have tried to develop an effective way to determine the function of the effect of damage size on elastic wave propagation.
