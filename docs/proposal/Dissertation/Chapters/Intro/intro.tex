The dissertation is the result of the author’s work as an assistant in the Department of Mechanics of Intelligent Structures, Institute of Fluid Flow Machinery, Polish Academy of Sciences.
Most of the work has been carried out within the framework of a research project, titled ‘Model-assisted damage identification function for Structural Health Monitoring of composite structures under a varied environmental condition', which was granted to the author by National Science Centre, Poland.
The primary objective of the dissertation was to develop a new approach to a sandwich structure assessment based on guided waves techniques under varied operating conditions.
The essence of the proposed method is to establish an accurate and numerically efficient model of the wave propagation in the sandwich structure to determine the severity of the damage.
A better understanding of guided wave behaviour in such structures and their interaction with damage will help develop more precise structural health monitoring strategies, reducing costs without compromising the safety of the liable structures.
