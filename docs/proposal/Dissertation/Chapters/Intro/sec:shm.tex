\Ac{shm} is the process of implementing an advanced damage identification strategy for structural or mechanical systems \cite{farrar2007introduction}.
The \ac{shm} systems usually consist of a sensor network, a \ac{dau}, and a central processor.
The \ac{dau} is responsible for collecting the data measured by the sensor network and the intact structure data if used \ac{shm} technique requires it.
A central unit then determines the current state of the structure through signal processing and statistical classification.
\ac{shm} implementation aims to extend the safe life of equipment, use lightweight materials, and reduce manufacturing and operating costs.
For example, the use of composites and adhesive bonding techniques reduces the aircraft's overall weight, thereby reducing fuel consumption \cite{scelsi2011potential}.
\ac{shm} is most commonly found in structures, such as aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering, where damage can have catastrophic consequences.

In his dissertation \cite{rytter1993vibrational}, Rytter classified the \ac{shm} system advancement into the following four levels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textbf{Level 1}: Detection
	\item[] \textbf{Level 2}: Localization,
	\item[] \textbf{Level 3}: Assessment,
	\item[] \textbf{Level 4}: Consequence.
\end{itemize}
The first level determines if there has been an adverse change in the geometric or material characteristics of the system, and the second level leads to localization of the damage.
The third and fourth level systems determine the size of the flaw and decide whether any maintenance is necessary, respectively.
While existence and location identification can be performed without knowledge of the intact state of the structure, the two last levels require a supervised learning mode \cite{worden2007fundamental}.
