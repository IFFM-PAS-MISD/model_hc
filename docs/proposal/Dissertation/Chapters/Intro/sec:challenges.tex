\section{Challenges in \acs{gw} propagation modelling for damage assessment in the \acs{hsc}}
\label{sec:challenges}

%% SECTION CONTENT ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The assessment of the damage severity in structural materials requires the development of a database of the effect of damage on system response \cite{worden2007fundamental}.
In the case of the \ac{hsc}, many factors affect the \ac{di} magnitude, such as damage localization, material properties and dimensions, the sensor position relative to the core cell and the boundary conditions.
Considering all the factors, the determination of DI by experimental means becomes very complicated, expensive and time-consuming.
Therefore, numerical analysis and computer simulations become the only practical tool to achieve the goal.

The most common \ac{hsc} numerical model used in analysing \acp{gw} and \ac{emi} found in the literature is the model based on the \ac{fem}.
Although the numerical results are close to the experimental results, the models have some limitations in performing the simulations in a reasonable computation time and operating memory consumption.
In order to alleviate these limitations the following techniques are employed:
\begin{itemize}
\item reduction of the sample dimensions \cite{hosseini2013numerical, tian2015wavenumber};
\item homogenisation of the core properties \cite{catapano2014multi, zhou2020debonding};
\item a simplified \ac{2d} model based on a cross-section of the panel \cite{li2019detection};
\item omission of an adhesive layer \cite{mustapha2013non}.
\end{itemize}
The time and memory consumption of the FEM simulations is due to the high spatial resolution needed to converge the numerical results.
When first-order elements are used, up to twenty nodes per the shortest wavelength of interest is recommended by Moser et al. \cite{moser1999modeling}.
Therefore, implementations with higher-order elements have been developed in recent years, achieving convergence even at six nodes \cite{willberg2012comparison}.
One is a method based on Lagrange polynomials as a shape function and \ac{gll} for integration scheme, termed \ac{sem}.
The \ac{sem} was initially developed for the numerical solution of the fluid flow in a channel by Patera \cite{patera1984spectral}.
The method has also been successfully employed for acoustic wave propagation in geological structures \cite{seriani1994spectral, komatitsch2000simulation},  and \ac{gw} propagation in engineering elements \cite{kudela2007wave, ostachowicz2011guided, rucka2010experimental,rekatsinas2017cubic}.
The time-domain \ac{sem} can be applied to complex structures e.g. stiffened panels \cite{schulte2011simulation, lonkar2014modeling}.
Versatility of the method is also related to the use of hybrid elements in combination with \ac{fem} formulation \cite{ha2009optimizing} and non-linear issues \cite{yu2020time, li2021hybrid}.

Due to the fast convergence and flexibility of the \ac{sem}, Kudela \cite{kudela2016parallel} applied the method to model \ac{hsc} with the \ac{fcgm}.
However, the author used \ac{3d} elements to model the core walls resulting in a huge \acp{dof}.
The model size could be reduced if the shell element replaced the solid one.
In addition, the surface-mounted \ac{pzt} is omitted in the above model, and a concentrated force is used as the disturbance source.
The sensors mesh would have to coincide with the plate mesh or use the coupling between both meshes to include the \acp{pzt} in the simulation.
Such coupling can be realised using an interface based on Lagrange multipliers proposed by Farhat and Roux for domain decomposition in \ac{fem} \cite{farhat1991method}.
Ashwin et al. implemented the interface for the \ac{sem} but did not adopt it to non-matching grids \cite{ashwin2014formulation}, which is required for model generalization.
My aim was to implement non-matching grid approach for the \ac{sem} and also enable coupling between shell and \ac{3d} elements.

The efficient model and the computational hardware play a significant role in the simulation speed. 
Kudela presented the \ac{sem} algorithm for parallel calculation on the \ac{gpu} \cite{kudela2016parallel}.
The multi-core architecture of the \ac{gpu} enables simultaneous vector operations, making simulations over 14 times as fast as those performed by a \ac{cpu}.
Therefore, using the \ac{gpu} card will make it more convenient to perform simulations of models with large number of \acp{dof} to determine the effect of damage size on system response.
Thus, the time integration algorithm must be modified to make parallel computing on the GPU still possible despite the usage of interface elements.
