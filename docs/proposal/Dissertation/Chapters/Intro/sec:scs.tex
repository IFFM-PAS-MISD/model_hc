Composites consist of two or more different materials, such as plastics, resins, metal alloys, glass, carbon or bio-based fibers, combined so that the final structure acquires new properties compared to those of the constituent materials.
The contribution of lightweight composite materials to the production of structural components has been increasing rapidly since the middle of the last century.
Due to the high strength-to-weight ratio, composite materials are extensively used in the aircraft and aerospace industry and civil constructions.

One group of composites includes sandwich panels, which are a type of multi-layered structure that are composed of the mid-core sandwiched between thin skins.
The skins, made of high mechanical properties, are designed to carry tensile or compressive stresses from longitudinal forces and bending moments.
On the other hand, the core transmits mainly shear stresses from transverse forces.
It also separates the skins, which increases structural stiffness for thin layers, improves insulation properties, and reduces weight while maintaining strength properties similar to the solid construction of the same density.
A popular core used in engineering structures is a honeycomb geometry core.
Fig.~\ref{fig:hcp} shows the construction of the \ac{hsc}.
The core can be made of aluminum, cardboard or Nomex.

However, these complex structures are exposed to various types of damage that are not found in metal alloy materials, e.g., hidden disbonds between the skin and the core, delamination of the skin plates, or the core impact damage.
They can occur either during a manufacturing process, storage or in-service life.
Therefore, advanced methods are required for on-line damage detection.
Thus, the use of composites has forced the development of advanced approaches to structural inspections.
