\section{GW Propagation in the Homogenized Core Model}
\label{sec:homogenized}

%% SECTION CONTENT ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In dissertation, comparative studies were conducted between the current model and the homogenized one. 
In the simplified model, the values of the material constants of the panel core were calculated according to the method presented by Malek and Gibson \cite{malek2015effective}.
The effective mechanical properties for an aluminium core are gathered in Table \ref{tab:properties_eff}, while the properties for other structures, i.e., the skin, the epoxy adhesive, the cyanoacrylate glue, and the sensors remained unchanged.
The core element has \(6 \times 6 \times 4\) nodes, and the mesh coincides with the skin mesh.
The elements of the other structures are the same as described in the previous section.
