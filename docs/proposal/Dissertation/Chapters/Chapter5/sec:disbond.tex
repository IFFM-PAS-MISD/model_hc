The skin and the core disbonds were evaluated to analyse the effect of damage on GW propagation.
A rectangular region of disbonds was investigated with the length along the wave propagation varying in width \(\mathrm{w_d} = [0,10,30,50,70,100,120]\) mm, and the damage length in the perpendicular direction is constant \(\mathrm{l_d} = 170\) mm.
The rectangle was centrally located between the transducers, as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:honeycomb}(\textbf{a}).
The selected dimensions of the defects correspond to the dimensions of disbonds made in the specimen to be measured experimentally.
The damage was done with a sharp hooked tool that detached the core from the adhesive layer cell by cell.
The dimensions of the disbond have a coarse tolerance, measuring the width by a calliper.
Due to the small aluminium sheet thickness, the core cells were squashed within the damaged area.

There were two kinds of disbond models under consideration.
The core cells were removed from the damaged area in the first model as in the mesh pictured in Fig.~\ref{fig:disbond}(\textbf{b}).
Whereas in the second model, all components were intact, and only the interface elements between the adhesive layer and the core were decoupled within the yellow area indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:disbond}(\textbf{c}).
