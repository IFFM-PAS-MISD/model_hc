%% CHAPTER INTRODUCTION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This chapter presents the sample configuration for numerical simulations based on the \ac{sem}.
The configuration is consistent with the specimen held for experimental validation of the model.
The description includes the overall dimensions of the \ac{hsc} panel, sensor placement, the material properties, and the excitation signal.
It is shown how the individual components were meshed to optimise computer operations.
In the chapter, two disbonds models are presented; in the first model, the core cells were removed from the damaged area, and in the second model, the interface elements were removed.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusionsSimul}

This chapter describes the full model configuration for computer simulations.
The mesh generation for each component, the excitation signals, and the description of damage modelling have been included.
Besides, the \ac{hcgm} is presented for comparison with the \ac{fcgm}.

An essential issue in the numerical model is the convergence of the solution in both spatial and temporal.
Poorly chosen model parameters cause significant errors in the results.
In the case of a time increment set above a critical value, calculations immediately tend to infinity.
The size and order of the spectral element should be chosen depending on the smallest propagating wavelength in the analyzed structure.
In turn, the smallest distance between nodes affects the critical value of the time step.
All this has a consequence on the duration of computer simulations.
