%% CHAPTER INTRODUCTION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This chapter presents the sample configuration for numerical simulations based on the \ac{sem}.
The configuration is consistent with the specimen held for experimental validation of the model.
The description includes the overall dimensions of the \ac{hsc} panel, sensor placement, the material properties, and the excitation signal.
It is shown how the individual components were meshed to improve computer operations.
In the chapter, two disbonds models are presented; in the first model, the core cells were removed from the damaged area, while in the second model, the interface elements between the adhesive layer and the core within the damage are were removed.

At the end of the chapter, the implemented specimen models are subjected to a temporal and spatial convergence test.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusionsSimul}

This chapter describes the full model configuration for computer simulations.
The mesh generation for each component, the excitation signals, and the description of damage modelling have been included.
Besides, the \ac{fcgm} is presented for comparison with the \ac{hcgm}.

An essential issue in the numerical model is the solution convergence in both spatial and temporal domains.
Poorly chosen model parameters cause significant errors in the results.
It was shown when a time increment is set over the critical value, displacements tend immediately to infinity.
The size and order of the spectral element should be chosen depending on the smallest propagating wavelength in the analysed structure.
In turn, the smallest distance between nodes affects the critical value of the time step.
All this has a consequence on the duration of computer simulations.
