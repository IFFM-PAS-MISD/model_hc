%% CHAPTER INTRODUCTION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This chapter presents the sample configuration for numerical simulations based on the \ac{sem}.
The configuration is consistent with the specimen held for experimental validation of the model.
The description includes the overall dimensions of the \ac{hsc} panel, sensor placement, the materials properties, and the excitation signal.
It is shown how the individual components were meshed to optimise computer operations.
In the chapter, two disbonds models are presented; in the first model, the core cells were removed from the damaged area, and in the second model, the interface elements were removed.
