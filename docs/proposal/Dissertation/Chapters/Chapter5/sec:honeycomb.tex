The modelled structure is composed of the following components: 2D for the core, epoxy adhesive and cyanoacrylate glue and 3D for the \ac{cfrp} plate and \acp{pzt}.
During the creation of the core mesh, special attention was taken to minimise the number of non-zero values in the matrix \(\textbf{G}\).
The core elements were selected for the slave mesh, with one spectral element dedicated to each honeycomb cell wall.
The master meshes of the skin panel and adhesive layer were divided by three rhombic elements into the area under the core cell.
The spectral element of the wall is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:struct_mesh}(\textbf{a}))
This way, the interface nodes coincide with those on the hexagon edges (red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:struct_mesh}(\textbf{b})).
The map of element nodes and their coordinates were generated by custom code developed in Matlab.
The resulting meshes of the core, adhesive layer and skin are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cas_mesh}.

The mesh for the cyanoacrylate adhesive consisted of five elements, with a second-order curve at the structure boundary as it is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:struct_mesh}(\textbf{c}).
This structure was connected to the skin with the non-matching interface elements with the adhesive mesh chosen as a slave one.
The \ac{pzt} mesh coincides with the glue mesh and they are connected with the matching interface elements.
