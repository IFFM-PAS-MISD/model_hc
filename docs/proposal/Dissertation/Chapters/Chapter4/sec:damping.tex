Propagating waves in the structure attenuate due to many factors, including geometric spreading, material damping, and dissipation into the adjacent domain.
This study adopted the Rayleigh damping model for the \ac{cfrp} skin and adhesive layer, while the damping for the aluminium core and \ac{pzt} was neglected.
Rayleigh damping model is defined as \cite{wandowski2017guided}:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\textbf{D}_{dd}^e = \alpha_M \textbf{M}_{dd}^e + \beta_K \textbf{K}_{dd}^e,
	\label{eq:damping}
\end{eqnarray}
\nomtypeD[alpha]{$\alpha_M$}{Mass-proportionality damping coefficient}{-}%
\nomtypeD[beta]{$\beta_K$}{Stiffness-proportionality damping coefficient}{-}%
where \(\alpha_M\) and \(\beta_K\) are the mass- and stiffness- proportionality coefficients.
In presented model, \(\beta_K\) was assumed equal to zero to ensure that matrix \(\textbf{D}_{dd}\) remains diagonal \cite{schulte2011simulation, wandowski2017guided}.
This assumption gives a good approximation when considering a single mode and a specific frequency. 
Ramadas showed slight differences in Lamb wave attenuation by analysing three models, i.e. mass-, stiffness-proportional and the sum of both \cite{ramadas2011modelling}.
However, the mass-proportional model is computationally incomparable to the other models due to the diagonal damping matrix.
