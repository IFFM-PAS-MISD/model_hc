In the chapter, the \ac{madif} was determined by which the milestone of the dissertation was achieved.
For this purpose, four damage indicators were analysed for two different models of the panel core, two of which proved useless.
From among them, the one that best matched the measurements was selected to determine the function.
The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements.
It demonstrates the confirmation of the thesis that it is possible to determine the damage severity function in \ac{hsc} by employing numerical simulations.
