%% CHAPTER INTRODUCTION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A series of computer simulations were performed for different bond sizes for both the full and simplified core model.
Two damage models were considered for both issues, i.e., removal of core cells and no coupling between the core and the adhesive layer.
The electrical voltage signal captured at the sensor electrode was then analyzed to determine \ac{madif}.
Several \acp{di} were used to determine the effect of damage on the propagation waveform.
Of all the indices, the one with the lowest percentage error to experimental measurements will be selected to determine the \ac{madif}.
