%% CHAPTER INTRODUCTION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A series of computer simulations were performed for different bond sizes for both the \ac{fcgm} and the \ac{hcgm}.
Two damage models were considered, i.e., the removed core cells  and no coupling between the core and the adhesive layer.
The electrical voltage signal captured at the sensor electrode was then analyzed to determine \ac{madif}.
Several \acfp{di} were used to determine the effect of damage on the propagation waveform.
Of all the indices, the one with the lowest percentage error to experimental measurements will be selected to determine the \ac{madif}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusionsSever}
In this chapter, the \ac{madif} was determined by which the milestone of the dissertation was achieved.
For this purpose, six \acp{di} were analysed for two different models of the panel core and two models of the damage.

Among the six indices, the best two \acp{di} were selected to determine the \ac{madif} function.
Their characteristics are monotonically over the entire damage range and a significant change in the index value for the most extensive damage.
The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements.
The \ac{hcgm} proved inadequate for determining the \ac{madif}, as no \ac{di} reached an mean error of less than 20\% relative to the experimental measurements.
It demonstrates the confirmation of the thesis that it is possible to determine the damage severity function in \ac{hsc} by employing numerical simulations.
