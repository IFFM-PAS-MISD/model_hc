The principal aim of this dissertation is to develop a new approach for the severity of damage identification in the \ac{hsc} with a pair of the \acp{pzt} to generate and sensing of \ac{gw}. 
The essence of the proposed method is the determination of damage influence function on characteristic parameters of the propagating waves in the structure.
Computer simulations define this function using a numerical model developed by the \ac{sem}.

Initially, the structure model is prepared for the pristine sample under various operating conditions such as ambient temperature.
Then parametric simulations for different damage scenarios are performed.
Based on the obtained results, the \ac{madif} is determined.
This function determines the flaw size depending on the \acp{pzt} response.
Debonding between the core and the skin is assumed as damage.
The following objectives of the dissertation are to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item develop a robust and efficient numerical model of the propagating \ac{gw} in the \ac{hsc} under varied ambient temperature,
	\item validate experimentally of the model,
	\item determine the \ac{madif} to define damage influence on the propagating waves,
	\item investigate the structureexperimentally under varied temperature conditions,
	\item propose a framework of the damage detection based on the \ac{madif}.
\end{itemize}
